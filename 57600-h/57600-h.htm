<span class="smaller">THE SURPRISE</span></h2>

<p>“I think,” said Lucy Merrill in a whisper
to her sister Dora, “that Uncle Dan
has a surprise for us.”</p>

<p>Dora was industriously setting the table for
supper. Lucy, at the kitchen dresser, was
peeling peaches. Lucy had on a big apron belonging
to her mother, and it covered both her
and the stool on which she sat. Dora wore a
pink apron over her checked pink-and-white
dress, and Dora’s apron was just like the big
one, only the right size.</p>

<p>Lucy owned a proper-sized apron also, but
Lucy had been unlucky enough to upset the
blueing bottle when she took a dish from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
kitchen closet. Her apron wasn’t hurt a bit,
but Mrs. Merrill had rinsed it out and now it
was flapping on the line in the back yard. The
closet floor was bluer than the apron and not
so easy to wash.</p>

<p>“What makes you think there is a surprise?”
asked Dora, standing back from the
table to see whether she had remembered
everything that anybody could use during supper.
No, she had forgotten the pulverized
sugar for the peaches.</p>

<p>“Because,” said Lucy, “he keeps following
Mother everywhere she goes, and I know he is
teasing her to do something. I heard him say
something about the beach.”</p>

<p>Dora stopped in the pantry doorway, her
eyes big and blue. “Do you think we can be
going to the beach?” she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“My, I hope so!” said Lucy. “We
haven’t been away this summer. And Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
said last night that the press was going to shut
down for the week after Labor Day.”</p>

<p>Dora looked out of the window across the
street at the low brick building where Father
Merrill worked in the printing office.</p>

<p>“We had better not ask too many questions,”
she said wisely. “Perhaps Uncle Dan
is going to take us to White Beach for a day.
But we did go to the vacation school, Lucy,
and that was a great deal of fun.”</p>

<p>“It was,” agreed Lucy. “And it cost a
dollar a week. But just one day at the beach
would be lovely. I wish the Sunday-school
picnic had gone there.”</p>

<p>Dora didn’t agree with Lucy. That annual
picnic had been held at World’s End
Pond. Even the salt water could not be nicer
than that place.</p>

<p>Just as Lucy finished the last peach, Mrs.
Merrill came in. Dora brought the sugar-bowl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
from the pantry and looked hard at her
mother. Sometimes it was possible to tell by
Mother’s face how she felt about things.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill did not seem disturbed, but
neither did she look as though she was thinking
of anything especially pleasant. She put
the rest of the supper on the table and told
Lucy to call her father and Uncle Dan.</p>

<p>It was Uncle Dan who told the secret.
Right in the middle of supper he turned to his
sister.</p>

<p>“You know, Molly,” he began, “Jack says
I may have his tent and we should need only
one.”</p>

<p>“<em>Dan!</em>” said Mother Merrill, and everybody
was still. The children looked at Uncle
Dan. Then Father Merrill laughed.</p>

<p>“A tent!” shrieked Lucy. Dora jumped
right out of her chair and ran around the
table to her uncle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are we going, too?” she asked quite
breathlessly. “Can I sleep in a tent? I never
did, you know.”</p>

<p>Mr. Merrill laughed again, and this time
Dan laughed with him.</p>

<p>“You’ve done it now, Dan,” said his sister.
“You may as well tell them.”</p>

<p>But Uncle Dan didn’t explain. “Oh,
Molly, then you <em>will</em> go?” he asked as eagerly
as the little girls.</p>

<p>“I suppose I shall have to,” said Mrs.
Merrill, but she didn’t look as though she
would find it very hard work.</p>

<p>“What is it? What is it?” Dora was asking
with her arms around her young uncle’s
neck.</p>

<p>“Quit choking me,” said Dan. “Go back
and eat your supper.”</p>

<p>Dora gave him one last hard hug before returning
to her chair. “I know it is nice,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
said. “But is it the beach, Uncle Dan, and
are we to sleep in a tent?”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“The press is going to shut down for a
week,” said Mrs. Merrill, “and Dan can get
off, too. He wants to go over to White Beach.
There’s a little shack we can have for not much
money, but it has only two rooms. Dan thinks
he can bunk on the porch. He wants Olive
Gates to go with us, and she and you children
would have to sleep in the tent.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be scared if Olive was with
us,” said Lucy. Dora was too happy to say
anything at all. Her eyes shone and looked
bluer than ever. When one is only eight, there
are a great many important things in life. To
go to the beach and to sleep in a tent seemed
almost too good to be true.</p>

<p>“Alice Harper is at the beach this summer,
but she sleeps in a house,” said Lucy. Nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was listening. Dan and Mr. Merrill were
both talking, and it was plain that they wanted
to go just as much as the children did.</p>

<p>“What shall we do with Timmy?” asked
Dora, a sudden cloud coming over her face. It
would never do to leave the tiger-striped pussy
to take care of himself for a week. “Can he
go with us?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Merrill. “He would be
scared to death, if he didn’t run away entirely.”</p>

<p>Dora looked so distressed that Mr. Merrill
could not stand it. “We’ll plan for Timmy,”
he said kindly. “I never did think much of
people who go off for a vacation and leave their
cats to take care of themselves. We will leave
the key of the house with Jim Baker, and ask
his little girl to come over twice a day to feed
Timmy and to let him into the kitchen every
night if he wants to sleep inside. But these
nice nights, Timmy may prefer to stay out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Dora’s face looked bright again. Of course
she could not enjoy the beach if Timmy were
not cared for. He was used to being petted
and fed regularly. Now there was not a cloud
in her sky.</p>

<p>Uncle Dan was as pleased as the little girls.
He talked much more than usual during supper,
and after it was over and the dishes were
being washed, he came to where his sister was
mixing bread.</p>

<p>“All right for me to ask Olive?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Merrill, smiling a little.
“Tell her we all want her to go with us.”</p>

<p>Dan was off in a hurry, but before he went
he gave his sister an awkward hug.</p>

<p>Never were dishes done with such speed!
Mrs. Merrill looked at them suspiciously but
did not say a word. Lucy had washed them
properly and Dora had wiped them as dry as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
could be, even though they worked so fast.
And yet neither of them knew why they were
hurrying. They were not to go to the beach
for three days, not until Saturday.</p>

<p>There was plenty to do between then and the
end of the week. First, they had to decide
what clothes to take, and were surprised to find
that Mother did not think as they did about
the dresses. She came and looked at them
when Lucy and Dora had laid them out on
their bed.</p>

<p>“You won’t need your good clothes,” she
said. “Those must be kept for school. You
will be playing on the beach all day, and not
need to be dressed up. When we go over, you
will have on one good dress apiece, and that is
enough.”</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora were disappointed. They
thought that people who went away on a vacation
should take <em>all</em> their best clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“But not people who live in tents,” said
Mrs. Merrill. “That makes a great difference.
We are only going to camp, you know.”</p>

<p>“But I may take Arcturus?” Dora begged,
bringing from her bureau the little silver bear
on her neck-chain, the bear which had been
named for a star. “Arcturus does really need
sea air, Mother.”</p>

<p>“He looks as though he were pining away,”
said Mrs. Merrill, but she said that on the way
over Dora might wear the necklace.</p>

<p>After Mother had edited that collection of
clothes, Lucy and Dora packed them very
easily into one suit-case. When they considered
that this was to be a camping-trip, it was
fun to see how much one could get on without.</p>

<p>Then there was the question of food.
Mother made a great many cookies, both of
sugar and molasses, and shut them into tin
boxes. She also made some cake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>On Friday a pleasant thing happened. The
man who owned the printing-press where Mr.
Merrill was foreman, said that he would have
all their things taken over to the beach in the
delivery truck belonging to the press. There
would be room on the driver’s seat for Mr. and
Mrs. Merrill. The little girls could sit on the
soft baggage in the back of the truck.</p>

<p>This made it very easy to take whatever they
wished. Mrs. Merrill wrapped up some more
blankets and made some more cake. She also
filled a basket with apples.</p>

<p>Though they were expecting to find it great
fun, Lucy and Dora did not ride on the back
of the truck. Jack Simmons, who lent Uncle
Dan his tent, had a little Ford car. He offered
to take Olive and Uncle Dan and the two
children. He would stay and help Uncle Dan
pitch the tent.</p>

<p>It was important to have a pleasant day on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Saturday. All Friday afternoon, while they
were doing the last things, Lucy and Dora
kept looking at the sky. Their looking did
not seem to make any difference, for it did not
become more blue, nor any less so, no matter
how hard they gazed.</p>

<p>One of the very last things was to go to the
Public Library and choose some books to take
with them. For, as Mrs. Merrill said, it might
rain at the beach, and then they would be glad
of something to read.</p>

<p>The children did not wish to think of rain,
but they chose the library books with great
care. Lucy decided to take “What Katy
Did,” but Dora could not find any book which
seemed suited to so important an occasion.
Finally she asked the librarian, Miss Perkins,
to choose one for her.</p>

<p>When Miss Perkins knew that the story
must last a week and was to be read at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
beach, she agreed that no ordinary book would
do. She went to a shelf in the back of the
library and brought Dora the “Story of Doctor
Dolittle.”</p>

<p>“You will like this book very much, Dora,”
she said. “And I think your Uncle Dan will
like it, too. It is a new book, just put into the
library, so you will take very good care of it,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will!” said Dora, who had caught
sight of the funny pictures in the text. “I
will be very careful of it, Miss Perkins.”</p>

<p>“And is Arcturus going to the beach with
you?” asked Miss Perkins as she slipped
“Doctor Dolittle” into an envelope for safe
traveling.</p>

<p>Dora explained that Arcturus would benefit
from sea air, and Miss Perkins at once said that
it would do him good.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">AT THE BEACH</span></h2>

<p>The house where the Merrills lived in
Westmore was a brown cottage, but it
seemed large and like a palace when
the children saw the shack at the beach. Still,
they liked the shack very much.</p>

<p>The front room had a couch and chairs, and
a square table which could be used for eating.
There was one wee bedroom and the smallest
kitchen ever seen. That kitchen was hardly so
large as a good-sized cupboard. Mrs. Merrill
could stand in its centre and reach everything
on all four walls. It contained a little sink
and an oil stove and some dishes,—not a great
many dishes, but that made fewer to wash.</p>

<p>The shack stood on a hard sandy ridge, not
near any other house. Behind, the sand sloped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to a road where automobiles were always passing.
In front there was sand that slid around
under foot, and then a broad hard beach and
the wonderful ocean. When the children came
on that sunny Saturday, for it was sunny in
spite of all their watching the sky, the sea was
a deep blue, with white fringes on the shore,
where the waves ran up and then slid back
again. The sand looked grayish-green, but
when the water touched it, it turned shiny.</p>

<p>Dora could not take her eyes off the ocean.
She forgot that she had wished to see Uncle
Dan and Jack Simmons put up the tent.
They pitched it near the shack, on the south
side, and drove the poles and the pegs in just
as hard as they could hammer them, so that
the wind would not loosen the ropes.</p>

<p>When the tent was up, Dora and Lucy went
inside. They pulled up all the beach peas
growing in the enclosed space, so there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
only a floor of warm dry sand, soft and fine.
Mrs. Merrill had brought on the truck some
rag rugs. These were spread on the clean sand
and the legs of the cots put on the rugs. If
this were not done, a cot might tumble down
when somebody was asleep on it.</p>

<p>Between the tent poles Uncle Dan stretched
a rope. This was for Olive and the little girls
to hang their clothes over. There was not
much room left when the three cots had been
set up and a chair brought from the house to
hold a wash-bowl and pitcher, but Lucy and
Dora thought it was beautiful.</p>

<p>“We will keep our suit-cases under the
beds,” said Olive. “And we must be careful
not to lose little things in this sand.”</p>

<p>It took only a few minutes to get settled in
the tent. Lucy and Dora put on some old
rompers they had brought for bathing dresses.
Olive put on her pretty blue suit and tied a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
blue handkerchief around her hair. Dora
thought she looked extremely nice. She decided
that when she was twenty, like Olive, she
would have a blue jersey bathing suit. But
meantime she liked her rompers very well.</p>

<p>Such a wonderful beach that was! There
were not many shells to pick up, but a great
many interesting pebbles. Almost immediately
the children found a strange creature,
shaped like a horse’s hoof, but transparent and
with a long, sharp tail. It seemed quite dead
and Dora was glad that it was. She really
would not like to meet it strolling down the
beach. Olive laughed and said that it was a
horseshoe crab and would not do her any
harm.</p>

<p>Quite soon, Father and Mother Merrill and
Uncle Dan came out, dressed to go into the
sea. Lucy and Dora waded in to their waists,
squealing because the water was so cold. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in just a few minutes it did not seem cold at all,
and they wanted to stay in all day.</p>

<p>Mother would not let them. Much sooner
than they wished, she told them to go out and
dress.</p>

<p>“It won’t do to stay too long the first time,”
she said. “Put on your old ginghams and you
may go barefooted and wade all you like, but
you have been in the water long enough for to-day.”</p>

<p>It seemed hard to come out when Uncle Dan
and Olive were still jumping waves and even
diving through them, but it would be fun to go
without shoes or stockings and to run into the
edge of the water whenever they wished. Besides,
Mother herself came out when they
did.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora dressed quickly. They
hung their wet clothes on a line which Mother
stretched from the corner of the shack to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
rear tent pole. Something was cooking on the
oil stove which smelled very good.</p>

<p>“When will dinner be ready?” asked Lucy.
“I am as hungry as can be.”</p>

<p>“It will be ready before the others are
dressed,” said her mother. “I wish they would
come out.”</p>

<p>Strange to say, Uncle Dan was willing to
leave the ocean before Olive. Father Merrill
grew cold and waded ashore, but Olive did not
look cold at all. It was Uncle Dan who
seemed shivery and whose lips turned blue.
Olive ran into the tent and presently threw
out her suit. Dora hung it on the line, after
brushing off what sand she could manage.</p>

<p>What a funny dinner that was! Nobody
had more than one spoon, and some of the
spoons were not a size any one would choose
to eat with. There were just forks enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
go around and Lucy and Dora had to share a
knife. But this was only the more sport.</p>

<p>Olive’s hair was wet and tied with a ribbon,
so she looked like a little girl with it hanging
down her back. There were not chairs for
everybody, and Uncle Dan sat on an old crate
which kept cracking and acting as though it
were going to break and let him down on the
floor. But Dan didn’t care if it did.</p>

<p>“Alice Palmer lives in a house somewhere at
this beach,” said Lucy contentedly. “It is
much more fun to camp.”</p>

<p>After dinner Mrs. Merrill told them all to
go down on the beach and she would wash the
dishes.</p>

<p>“We will do nothing of the kind,” said
Olive. “You got dinner alone and I shall
wash the dishes myself and the children will
wipe them. You will not be allowed in the
kitchen, Molly Merrill, and indeed, there is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
room for anybody but Lucy and Dora and
me.”</p>

<p>“Well!” said Mrs. Merrill, and she put on
her hat and went down to the edge of the water
with Father Merrill.</p>

<p>There was no can for the garbage, so Olive
gave the dish to Uncle Dan and told him to
take it down the beach away from all the
houses and dig a hole and bury it.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Dan. “Why not
throw it out for the gulls to eat?”</p>

<p>Olive said he was not to do this. The gulls
might not eat it immediately and the flies
would collect and it would be unpleasant for
people who were passing. It must be buried,
and quite deep at that.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora were amused to see Uncle
Dan go off to bury the garbage just as Olive
said. But she looked so pretty with her wavy
hair tied back with the blue ribbon that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
was no wonder Uncle Dan did what he was
told.</p>

<p>For dinner, they had used every dish in the
shack, except one big and very black kettle,
but even then it did not take long to wash them.
Just for fun, Lucy and Dora counted as they
wiped. There were precisely forty-three
dishes, and that included all the spoons and
knives and forks.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Olive as they finished, “don’t
you think it would be nice to have sandwiches
for supper and eat them on the beach?”</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora both thought it would be an
excellent plan.</p>

<p>“Then let’s go and ask your mother,” said
Olive. “Because if she is willing, we will
make the sandwiches right now, and then we
shall not have anything to do for supper except
eat it.”</p>

<p>Olive and the little girls ran a race to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which would first reach Mrs. Merrill. Lucy
won, because her legs were longer than Dora’s
and, anyway, Dora wasn’t trying very hard to
beat Olive.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill approved of the sandwiches.
She said that Olive might plan supper exactly
as she liked. So they ran back to the shack.</p>

<p>By this time Uncle Dan had buried the garbage
and he helped make the sandwiches.
Some were filled with peanut butter and some
with orange marmalade. Olive also boiled six
eggs, one for each. She wrapped the sandwiches
in waxed paper, and put them in a
basket covered with a damp cloth. She put in
the eggs and the salt and the pepper, and a loaf
of cake and a knife to cut it with. She put in
some peaches and some paper napkins.</p>

<p>“Our supper is ready,” she announced.
“All we have to do is to come for the basket
when we want to eat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Dan wanted to walk up the beach to
see the life-saving station. Olive’s hair was
dry now, so she twisted it up and pinned on a
pretty hat made of blue silk ribbon. They invited
the little girls to go, but both preferred
to play in the sand.</p>

<p>Lucy took a big spoon from the kitchen to
dig a well, but Dora planned to collect shiny
white and gray-green pebbles and make a
house for herself. This she did by outlining
the walls with pebbles and leaving spaces for
doors and windows. The beach was so wide
that there was room for a large house. Quite
soon Lucy came and began to make herself a
house next door to Dora’s.</p>

<p>To build the house took a long time, but just
as it was finished, Dora had a visitor. The tide
was coming, and the first she knew, old Father
Ocean ran right in through her front door
without even so much as knocking! He did
not stay, but ran promptly out again, leaving
wet marks all over the front hall of Dora’s
new house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;" id="illus2">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Dora did not say anything then, but the
next time a big wave rushed up, the water came
into her parlor and curled about her bare toes.</p>

<p>“I shall have to move,” she said to Lucy.</p>

<p>“Or go away until to-morrow,” suggested
Lucy. “Look! How low the sun is.”</p>

<p>Where <em>had</em> that afternoon gone? It did not
seem as though they had been playing more
than a few minutes. But the sea was growing
gray instead of blue, and the sun struck long
level lines through the air. Up by the shack
Father and Mother were enjoying themselves;
Mother sitting quite idle, just looking at the
water; Father lying on his back in the sand.
Away down the beach Olive and Uncle Dan
were coming. It must be time for that picnic
supper.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">ABOUT ARCTURUS</span></h2>

<p>Lucy and Dora thought it was great
fun to go to bed in the tent. They
were even willing to undress at their
usual hour and not tease to be out on the moonlit
beach.</p>

<p>The only place to put their clothes was over
the rope Uncle Dan had stretched between the
poles. They hung them there, and the clothes
immediately slid into a heap in the middle of
the rope. Dora could not make hers stay
neatly at one end.</p>

<p>Olive did not go to bed with the children.
She and Uncle Dan took the trolley car which
ran along the road behind the shack and went
to another beach where there was a Saturday
night dance. Lucy and Dora did not mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
The window of the room where Father and
Mother were to sleep was close at the end of
the tent.</p>

<p>After Mother had tucked them into their
cots, Lucy went quickly to sleep but Dora lay
with eyes wide open. Because of the moon the
tent was bright, and through its open flaps she
could see the waves breaking lazily on the
shore, and hear the surge of the water. Across
from the moon came a path of light.</p>

<p>For quite a long time Dora watched the
sparkles and then suddenly she began to think
about bears, not tiny silver bears like Arcturus,
but real ones, full-sized and covered with hair.
This was not a pleasant thought.</p>

<p>Dora knew there were no bears anywhere
near White Beach. Still, it seemed possible
that one <em>might</em> walk into that open tent. And
then she heard a rustle outside.</p>

<p>Dora gave a little gasp. At first, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
thought she would call Mother, but she remembered
that she had wanted to sleep in the tent
and that doing so was a part of camping. To
be sure, she had not expected that Lucy would
be asleep when she wasn’t.</p>

<p>After that first gasp, Dora decided not to
scream. She lay still, and listened hard. In a
minute, a cricket began to chirp.</p>

<p>When she heard the cricket, Dora felt much
better. It surely would not be chirping if a
bear were walking round the tent. It would
not dare to make any noise. But she thought
it would be comforting to have Arcturus for a
bed-fellow.</p>

<p>The suit-case was under Lucy’s cot, so Dora
got up and pulled it into the moonlight.
Without any trouble she found the silver bear
on his slender chain and snapped it about her
neck. Then she went back to bed and did not
think any longer about real bears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead, she thought of fairies and of a poem
she had once read in a library book. She tried
hard to remember how it went.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When the moon shines bright on the pebbly beach</div>
<div class="verse">And the sea is half-asleep;</div>
<div class="verse">Heaving, heaving, evermore,</div>
<div class="verse">And the surf falls lazily along the shore,</div>
<div class="verse">And the whispering ripples creep.</div>
<div class="verse">Then the wet little fairies come out of the waves</div>
<div class="verse">And dance in the light of the moon.</div>
<div class="verse">With gossamer dresses of white sea-foam,</div>
<div class="verse">Brown seaweed sash and coral comb,</div>
<div class="verse">And spottled shells for shoon.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>While Dora was thinking about the poetry,
she watched the edge of the sea and thought
she saw one fairy creep out and shake the spray
from its wings. She wasn’t quite sure, for it
might have been a sandpiper. When Olive
came in softly, about midnight, Dora was as
sound asleep as Lucy.</p>

<p>Next morning, the sun touched Dora’s cot
rather than either of the others, just as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
moon had done. When she opened her eyes,
the sun was just above the horizon, its lower
rim not clear from the water. Never before
had she seen it so tremendous! It looked a
perfect elephant of a sun.</p>

<p>A soft little breeze came into the tent, blowing
straight from sea. Sandpipers really were
running along the edge of the foam and the
beach was washed hard and smooth. Not a
trace was left of Dora’s house except a huddle
of the larger pebbles. Every footmark was
gone. A perfectly new and fresh playground
lay before them.</p>

<p>Just then Lucy woke and she and Dora
looked at the sunrise sky and talked in whispers
because Olive was still asleep. Her hand
was tucked under one cheek, and a long braid
of hair lay across her pillow.</p>

<p>They decided to get up and dress very
quietly. It was easy to be quiet because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
sand under foot muffled every step, and easy to
be quick because they had very few clothes to
put on.</p>

<p>Just as they were dressed, Lucy stopped
short. “O my!” she said in a whisper, and
stood on one foot.</p>

<p>Twisted about her bare toes was a little silver
chain.</p>

<p>Dora looked at it. Then she put her hand
to her neck. Arcturus and his leash were gone.
That was her silver chain tangled in Lucy’s
toes, but where was the bear? She gave a
frightened sob, which woke Olive.</p>

<p>Olive sat up in her cot and looked from one
to the other. “What’s the matter?” she asked.</p>

<p>Between sobs, Dora explained that she had
felt lonely after Lucy went to sleep and had
taken Arcturus into bed with her. When she
awoke, she never thought of him. There was
the chain, but where was Arcturus?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Olive got up at once. She put on her kimono
and her slippers. Then she took the top
blanket from her bed and spread it carefully
on the sand. Next, she took Dora’s blankets
and shook them carefully over hers. If
Arcturus were hiding in the bed, he must come
out. But he did not.</p>

<p>Olive shook Dora’s pillow and her mattress
and her nightdress, and felt the pockets of her
dress and looked in the suit-case. She emptied
the suit-case and shook every garment. Trying
not to cry, Dora watched Olive and Lucy
helped her. But Arcturus was not anywhere.</p>

<p>“I am afraid he is in the sand,” said Olive.
“Show me just where you have walked since
you got up.”</p>

<p>“I have been right by my cot except when
I washed myself,” choked Dora.</p>

<p>Olive felt all about in the sand by Dora’s
bed and sifted it through her fingers. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
she sat back against the cot, for she really did
not know what else to do. She was very sorry
for Dora, and Dora knew it. She crept into
Olive’s arms and cried softly, so as not to wake
the people in the shack.</p>

<p>Arcturus had certainly run away, but after
her cry Dora felt better. Lucy and Olive both
were hugging her tightly and though it was
hard to lose her dear bear, she still had those
who loved her.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we shall find him yet,” said Olive.
“Let’s think so, Dora, and don’t let it spoil
your nice time at the beach. Perhaps Dan
will know something more to do. Perhaps
Arcturus has just gone to be a sand-bear for a
little while.”</p>

<p>At this Dora smiled through her tears. She
kissed Olive. Of course it would not be right
to spoil things by being sad, and she would
hope for the best. There might be a worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
fate for Arcturus than being a jolly little sand-bear.</p>

<p>So they all got up from the rag rugs and
Lucy picked up Olive’s pretty rose-trimmed
hat which had slipped from the nail where she
tried to hang it.</p>

<p>“You might put that under my cot, Lucy,”
said Olive. “It won’t stick on that nail, and
I don’t believe I shall wear it here. I like my
ribbon one better for the beach.”</p>

<p>Lucy tucked the hat under Olive’s bed and
then she and Dora went down on the shore.
Olive said that she knew it would be hard for
Dora to speak about Arcturus, so she would do
it for her. She would ask the others not to say
very much about him, only to look for him
everywhere they went.</p>

<p>This made it easier for Dora to come to
breakfast. She could even smile when they
all called her Theodora. Usually, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Mother remembered that on Sundays she
wished to have her whole name used. This
morning even Uncle Dan thought about
it.</p>

<p>The tide was going out, and away to the
right were some shining mud-flats. Uncle
Dan and Olive said they were going to dig
clams and Lucy and Dora went with them to
pick up the clams after they were dug. There
was only one clam-fork, but Mr. Merrill found
an old spade which he thought he could use.
They all put on their bathing suits.</p>

<p>When Dora reached the clam-flat, she did
not like it very well. She had not known that
clams chose to live in such queer mud. It
seemed much dirtier than ordinary wet earth,
and after Dora and Lucy had sunk into it far
above their ankles, they told Olive that they
would let her pick up the clams. If she needed
help, she might call, and they would come, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
it did not look as though three people would
be needed to collect clams for Father and
Uncle Dan.</p>

<p>Olive thought she could manage all the
clams, so Lucy and Dora went back to the
hard beach and made some more houses.
Lucy’s had a great many large rooms and long
halls with plenty of windows. Dora made a
small one which was just like the brown cottage
she lived in on Main Street.</p>

<p>Father and Uncle Dan heard what Olive
and the children were saying about the clams,
and so they dug very hard and very fast. The
clams were not so many that Olive needed help
to pick them up, but there were plenty for a
chowder and for steaming, which was much
more than either she or Mrs. Merrill had expected.
They decided to have the steamed
clams for dinner and to make the chowder for
supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>When the clams were dug, Mr. Merrill carried
the basket home and Lucy and Dora saw
Uncle Dan and Olive coming up the beach.
Olive was carrying a heavy shovel and Uncle
Dan had a queer-looking thing over his shoulder.
Even when he came up to the shack the
children did not know what the thing could be.
It was a large oblong frame of wood, with a
wire screen bottom, and was tilted up on one
end.</p>

<p>“We are going to look for Arcturus,” said
Olive, as Uncle Dan dumped the frame beside
the tent. “Some men have been getting
gravel from the ridge and using this. We
have borrowed it for a little while.”</p>

<p>Neither Lucy nor Dora could guess how
this frame was to help find the silver bear.
Uncle Dan and Olive took out of the tent the
three cots and the single chair. Olive shook
each rag rug carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Uncle Dan carried the frame into the
tent. He set it up and lifted a shovelful of
sand and threw it against the screen bottom.
All the sand went straight through, but the
pebbles, even some smaller than Arcturus, fell
back in a pile. It would not be possible for
Arcturus to go through that wire screening.</p>

<p>Uncle Dan took every single bit of loose
sand from the space covered by the tent, and
threw it against the screen. Olive and Lucy
and Dora watched the pebbles which fell back.
Arcturus could not escape three pairs of eyes.
But finally there was no more loose sand, only
a kind of stiff dry clay, and no Arcturus.</p>

<p>Dora tried hard not to cry but she felt much
grieved. It did not seem possible that the bear
could evade a search like that. She managed
to thank Uncle Dan, who was as sorry as Olive
that it had been of no use. They smoothed the
sand floor and Uncle Dan returned the screen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and the shovel. No, there was nothing left but
to think of Arcturus as being a sand-bear now,
enjoying himself by the sea.</p>

<p>Then they went swimming, and how Uncle
Dan and Father Merrill did laugh at Olive.
Olive said that it was Sunday morning and
that she usually went to church instead of into
the ocean. She should take with her a cake of
salt-water soap and call it a bath. She wasn’t
sure it was quite right to go swimming just for
fun. She should feel more comfortable about
it if she took the soap.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill did not laugh at Olive. She
said she was glad that Olive liked to keep Sunday
different from other days.</p>

<p>During all that week at White Beach
it rained only a part of one afternoon.
Both “Doctor Dolittle” and “Katy”
stayed shut into Mother’s suit-case. After the
mishap to Arcturus, nothing precious was
trusted in the tent. Even on the day the rain
fell, the air was so warm and soft that Lucy
and Dora played on the shore just the same
and thought the sprinkles only the more fun.</p>

<p>Every day people passed up and down the
beach. Sometimes they were children who
would stop and help Lucy and Dora build a
sand fort or run races with them in the edge
of the water. Sometimes they had a collection
of pebbles to be admired, or a sea-urchin picked
up in the sand. These were considered great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
treasures. Some were worn smooth by the
waves, and some—but these were fewer—still
had long green spines sticking to their shells.</p>

<p>Except for the friendly children, Lucy and
Dora paid very little attention to the passers-by.
They could see as many people as
they wished in Westmore, but in Westmore
there were no gulls and no beach and no sea.</p>

<p>One afternoon Dora did look up when a
gentleman on horseback came down the shore.
The horse was the color of a bright chestnut
and his hair reflected the sun. Somebody must
have brushed that horse extremely hard to
make him so shiny.</p>

<p>Dora looked at the horse and Lucy looked at
the rider and presently Lucy smiled a little.</p>

<p>The gentleman glanced at the children and
smiled also. “Aren’t you Mr. Merrill’s little
girls?” he asked.</p>

<p>At this Dora looked up. It was Alice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Harper’s father. They often saw him in
church.</p>

<p>Mr. Harper made the pretty horse stop.
He asked Lucy where they were staying. He
looked at the shack and at the tent beside
it.</p>

<p>“And do you sleep in the tent?” he asked.
Lucy explained that they did.</p>

<p>“Alice has wanted to sleep in one this summer,
but her mother wasn’t willing. I know
it is great fun. I will tell Alice that you are
here and I think she will be down to see you.
Our house is the other side of the life-saving
station.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harper and the shiny horse went on
along the beach. Dora watched for some time.
The horse walked down by the water where the
sand was hard, but whenever a wave came curling
in, he danced up the beach. Evidently he
did not like to get his feet wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>When the children went up to supper they
told Mrs. Merrill about their visitor.</p>

<p>“He had a very pretty horse. It shone like
a bottle,” said Dora.</p>

<p>“Do you think Alice will come to see us?”
asked Lucy.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t set my heart on it,” said Mrs.
Merrill.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Harper is always very nice to everybody
in the church,” said Olive, who was trying
to make toast over the oil stove and was not
succeeding very well.</p>

<p>“I know she is,” agreed Mrs. Merrill.
“But church isn’t the beach, and people who
live in big houses don’t always want to know
people who live in small ones.”</p>

<p>Olive burned a slice of bread and gave a
little moan over it, so Dora forgot to ask just
what Mother meant. She felt quite sure that
Alice would come. Of course, her father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
might forget to tell her. Fathers did sometimes
forget very important things, like posting
letters and giving messages and bringing home
yeast-cakes.</p>

<p>Lucy also thought that Alice would come,
and they were not disappointed. The very
next afternoon, which was Friday, while they
were playing on the beach, Alice came, and
Mrs. Harper with her. Alice stopped with
the children and Mrs. Harper went straight
to the shack to speak with Mrs. Merrill and
Olive. Father and Uncle Dan had gone fishing.</p>

<p>Alice asked a great many questions. She
wished to know how long they had been there,
how long they were going to stay, and why
they had not been to see her.</p>

<p>It was easy to answer the first question and
the second answered itself, because school began
the next Monday and the printing-press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
started work again, but the third question was
not so easy.</p>

<p>“We did not know where your house was,”
said Lucy at last.</p>

<p>“You could have asked,” said Alice.
“There are no girls my age anywhere near
me. I have had nobody to play with all summer
but babies and boys. The babies are
very well for a time, but they can’t do much
but dig holes in the sand, and I don’t like
the boys at all. They do horrible things,
like putting crabs in shoes and dead fish in
playhouses.”</p>

<p>“Girls are nicer to play with,” said Lucy.
“Would you like to make a pebble house,
Alice, or would you like to wade?”</p>

<p>“I would like to go into your tent,” said
Alice eagerly.</p>

<p>The children took Alice up to the tent,
which she admired very much. “What fun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
it must be!” she said. “I wish I could sleep
here with you just one night.”</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora began to wonder if this
could be planned. It did not seem easy, for
there was not room for another cot, even if
there were one to bring from the house. It
would be hard to find space for even a doll’s
bed. As it was, Lucy’s doll had to sleep with
her. Dora’s Teddy wore a fur coat and <em>he</em> sat
up all night. It would not be polite to ask
Olive to give Lucy her cot, and there was no
place for her to sleep if she did. There seemed
no way to make Alice’s wish come true.</p>

<p>When the children came out of the tent, they
saw Mrs. Merrill on the porch with her hat on
and a coat over her arm.</p>

<p>“Goody!” said Alice. “Mother was going
to ask your mother if she didn’t want to go
over to the Port in the motor-boat. We are
going, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>What a pleasant surprise this was! Lucy
and Dora thought it very kind of Mrs. Harper.
They had half envied Father and Uncle
Dan their trip.</p>

<p>Everybody walked up the beach beyond the
life-saving station where the boats lay ready
to be launched the moment they were needed.
Ships need help sometimes as well as people,
and these boats were always waiting for a call
from sea.</p>

<p>Beyond the station lay a row of pretty
houses on a curving strip of land which ran
around a big bay. Across, was the town which
Alice called the Port.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harper took them up on the porch of
her cottage and gave them some lemonade and
cookies. She brought out the pitcher herself
and Alice brought the glasses. It tasted very
good because there was no ice at the shack to
keep things cool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>After drinking the lemonade they went
down to the boat-house where a man helped
them into the motor-boat. Lucy and Dora had
been around World’s End Pond in a launch,
but this one was much more trim and tidy and
went through the water much faster. Its
boards were very white and all the brass shone
and it plunged right at each wave as though
it were going to dive through rather than sit
on top.</p>

<p>Dora became very quiet. The foam flew on
either side, and the waves were as blue as
Mother’s blueing water, but on the whole she
liked the pond better than the sea. For one
thing, there was not so much of it.</p>

<p>Lucy and Alice went forward in the launch.
Alice wanted to sit on the roof of the little
cabin. Mrs. Harper said she might if the man
at the wheel thought it was safe.</p>

<p>“Safe as lying in a cradle,” said the man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
so Lucy and Alice climbed up where they could
get all the wind that blew.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to go with them?” Mrs.
Harper asked Dora.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Dora shyly. She was
sitting next Olive and presently she cuddled so
close that Olive understood and put an arm
around her.</p>

<p>Before long the waves grew even larger and
some of them broke over the bow of the launch.
Alice and Lucy were spattered with spray and
both gave little shrieks.</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel well, Dora?” asked Olive
in a whisper. “Don’t you want to go to the
Port?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather go on land,” said Dora. “<em>Any</em>
land.”</p>

<p>Dora spoke softly but Mrs. Harper heard.
“Poor child!” she said. “And I thought she
would enjoy a ride.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Harper opened a locker, which was a
cupboard under the seat, and took out a big
soft shawl. She spread it on the seat and told
Dora to lie down.</p>

<p>Dora was extremely glad to feel herself on
something flat. She shut her eyes and kept
still while Mother and Mrs. Harper wrapped
her in the rug. Then Mrs. Harper spoke to
the man at the wheel. He turned the launch in
a different direction so that the bow did not hit
the waves quite so hard.</p>

<p>It seemed a long time to Dora before they
were back at the boat-house. The launch had
been out only about an hour, but she thought it
was the whole afternoon. Alice and Lucy
thought it was about ten minutes.</p>

<p>Just as soon as she stepped ashore, Dora
began to feel better, and she did not really
need the hot soup which Mrs. Harper insisted
she should drink. By the time they were home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
at the little shack, Dora could hardly believe
that she had not enjoyed the trip.</p>

<p>“But would you like to go again in the
launch?” asked Olive.</p>

<p>No, Dora would not go so far as to say that.
She felt surprised and hurt, that the sea which
looked so lovely, could make her feel so disagreeable.</p>

<p>When the fishermen came they brought with
them five fish. Four were ordinary plain fish
such as the children often saw at the market,
but the fifth one, which Uncle Dan had caught,
was much longer and broader and looked
strange. Dora at once asked Uncle Dan its
name.</p>

<p>“I think it is a walrus,” said Dan gravely.</p>

<p>Lucy looked respectfully at the fish but
Dora looked at Uncle Dan. Though his face
was quite unsmiling, there was a twinkle in his
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“It must be a walrus,” he went on, “because
I am a carpenter, you see.”</p>

<p>Lucy didn’t “see” at all, but Dora laughed
in delight. Of <em>course</em> it must be a walrus. She
remembered the poem perfectly.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The Walrus and the Carpenter</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Were walking close at hand;</div>
<div class="verse">They wept like anything to see</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Such quantities of sand:</div>
<div class="verse">‘If this were only cleared away,’</div>
<div class="verse indent1">They said, ‘it would be grand!’</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘If seven maids with seven mops</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Swept it for half a year,</div>
<div class="verse">Do you suppose,’ the Walrus said,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">‘That they could get it clear?’</div>
<div class="verse">‘I doubt it,’ said the Carpenter,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And shed a bitter tear.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dora laughed hard at Uncle Dan waving the
fish and pretending to wipe his eyes. Olive
understood and laughed also, but Lucy and
Mrs. Merrill didn’t understand the joke at all.</p>

<p>Then the fishermen were told about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
launch trip and Dora was rather sorry they had
to know that she did not enjoy it. But she felt
comforted when Father confided to her that
he did not like the motion of the boat himself.</p>

<p>“It was all right as long as we kept moving,”
he said, “but when we anchored to fish, I
felt as though my dinner wasn’t to be depended
upon.”</p>

<p>“I know just how you felt,” said Dora
earnestly. “I grew so jiggly that my stomach
came up on top of me.”</p>

<p>And the very next day they had to go home.
The truck was to come over early in the afternoon
and everything must be ready. Uncle
Dan and Olive were going back by trolley and
they said they would take the children, but
Lucy and Dora decided to ride on the truck.</p>

<p>For that last dinner they had another chowder,
because it was easy to make and to heat
when there was not a great deal of time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
cooking. And it was odd how easy the packing
seemed. Scarcely five minutes were
needed to tuck into the suit-case the clothes it
had taken so long to choose. The cookies and
cake and apples were all eaten.</p>

<p>Only, as Dora folded the last rug and looked
around the empty tent, ready now to be taken
down, she thought of Arcturus and the tears
came to her eyes. She did not mean anybody
to see them, because they had all been so kind.
Mother had not said one word about her being
careless and Lucy offered to give back the pink
coral heart Dora had lent to her. But when
the tent was all pulled to pieces, the thought
of her dear bear was more than she could stand.
Olive saw her wipe away a tear and put an
arm around her.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry, Dora,” she said. “Indeed,
if I could, I would get you another bear.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be Arcturus,” choked Dora.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” agreed Olive, “but it might be his
twin brother. I don’t suppose it would be possible
to buy one in this country, and I shall
never be lucky enough to go to Switzerland.
But I am <em>thinking</em> you a little bear, Dora.
Can’t you feel him growing?”</p>

<p>Dora pretended she could, and when she
came out of the tent, nobody could have suspected
any tears. But as they left White
Beach, her last look was not for the sea nor
the sky nor the gulls, nor the goldenrod and
asters along the sandhills, but for the place
where the tent had stood, and in her heart she
was hoping that Arcturus would be very happy
in his new life by the shore.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">WHEN SCHOOL BEGINS</span></h2>

<p>Timothy was glad to see Lucy and
Dora come home. He looked fat, and
Marion Baker said he had slept in the
kitchen every night but one. On Wednesday
evening he chose to visit his friends. But
Timmy had evidently been lonesome, for he
purred loudly and followed the children up to
their room. As soon as the suit-case was
opened, he got into it to see whether they had
brought anything for him. Dora had done so.
There was in the suit-case a stalk of catnip
for Timothy.</p>

<p>Some mail and papers were at the house and
when Mother looked over the letters there was
one for Dora from Miss Chandler, whom she
called Aunt Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Dora planned to answer the letter on Sunday.
There was much to tell about the beach.
Only, when she began to write, she thought of
Arcturus and felt quite sad. When she spoke
of him, Mother suggested that Dora should tell
Miss Chandler how Arcturus had run away.
It was right that she should know, because she
gave Dora the little bear.</p>

<p>To write about it in a letter was easier than
speaking of it when she saw Miss Chandler, so
Dora wrote what had happened and how sorry
she was. Then she told her about the nice
time at the beach, and what fun it was to sleep
in a tent, and how she and Lucy rode home
sitting on a roll of blankets in the back of the
truck.</p>

<p>When the letter was finished, Mother looked
at it. She told Dora about one word which
was spelled wrong and said that the writing
looked neat. Then she told Dora how to direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the envelope and gave her a postage stamp
from Father’s desk.</p>

<p>Dora stuck the stamp on the proper corner
and put the letter in the box on the post by
Mr. Giddings’ drug-store. Then she came
back to the house and read the “Story of Doctor
Dolittle.” She thought it was one of the
most interesting and funniest stories she had
ever read. She tried to have Lucy enjoy it,
but Lucy liked “What Katy Did” better.</p>

<p>After supper that Sunday night, Dora followed
Mother into her bedroom.</p>

<p>“I have a plan,” she said. “Mother, you
know Aunt Margaret told me that her birthday
is the same as mine. Both are next Friday.
I would very much like to make her a
birthday present, Mother. You see she gave
me Arcturus and the other little charms. And
anyway, it would be nice, because she was so
kind to us in the vacation school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill thought this was a nice plan.
She asked Dora what she wanted to give Miss
Chandler.</p>

<p>“I have twenty-five cents,” said Dora,
“which I earned picking blackberries. I
thought I could buy her some paper to write
letters on.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Mrs. Merrill, “that Miss
Chandler would like better a gift which you
made for her. You know you did some cross-stitching
for the bedspread this summer.
Haven’t you still the paper with the pattern
showing the colored squares?”</p>

<p>Yes, Dora still had the paper pattern of the
roses.</p>

<p>“I am going to the city to-morrow,” said
Mrs. Merrill. “Would you like me to buy a
bit of the canvas they use for cross-stitching,
and four skeins of colored cotton? Then you
could make a pincushion for Miss Chandler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with the cross-stitched roses on it. I have a
piece of pretty white linen you may use for the
top, and I will help you put the cushion together.
Don’t you think that would be a nice
present?”</p>

<p>Dora was perfectly delighted with Mother’s
plan. She begged her to find the piece of white
linen at once, and when she saw it, she was sure
that it would make an unusual cushion. She
was so afraid that Mother would forget what
an important errand that canvas was, that she
took a pencil and wrote it down on a piece of
paper and stuck the paper into Mother’s purse,
where she could not fail to see it.</p>

<p>Next morning school began. Lucy and
Dora were glad, for both liked to go to school.
Lucy was one grade ahead of Dora and so
each year, Dora had the teacher Lucy was
leaving. Because she heard Lucy talk about
them at home, she felt acquainted immediately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and it was not hard to change into a higher
grade.</p>

<p>This year Lucy was sorry to leave Miss
Leger, and she was not sure she should like
Miss Scott, into whose room she was going.
Some of the older girls did not like her.</p>

<p>While Mother was tying their hair-ribbons,
Lucy spoke to her about it. Mother did not
think Miss Scott would be cross.</p>

<p>“If you learn your lessons, Lucy, and behave
yourself as well as you should do, your
teacher will not be cross. It is only sick
or naughty children who can’t get on at
school.”</p>

<p>Lucy admitted that Mother’s advice
sounded sensible, and she and Dora started for
school. Lucy had on a white waist, which had
buttoned to it a pink plaid kilted skirt. On
the waist was a collar of the pink plaid gingham.
When Mother planned that dress, Lucy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
did not think she should like it, but now the
dress was made, she liked it very much.</p>

<p>Dora wore a new dress, too. Hers was a
loose blue gingham which was smocked at the
shoulders and had a round white collar. They
both wore socks and sneakers, because Mother
thought best to save their leather shoes for
colder weather.</p>

<p>All the children seemed glad to come back to
school. All the little girls wore clean crisp
dresses, slipped on five minutes before they
started for the schoolhouse. All the little boys
had clean shirt-waists and their hair brushed
back very hard and very wet.</p>

<p>The children went into the rooms belonging
to their new grades. Lucy hoped to get a
back seat in a row of desks, for all the girls
considered the back seats the most desirable.
Lucy didn’t get the seat she wanted, but the
one she did get was the third from the back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and beside a window, so that was not so
bad.</p>

<p>Dora didn’t care where she sat, and this was
lucky, because Miss Leger told the children to
stand, and then arranged them according to
how tall they were, with the smallest ones in
front. This put Dora in the first seat of all,
but she liked it as well as any other.</p>

<p>Everything went well until recess and then
an accident happened to Dora. The little girls
were playing tag on the grassy grounds about
the schoolhouse. The older girls were walking
up and down with arms around each other’s
waists, talking of the many things which had
happened during the long vacation.</p>

<p>Dora was playing with five other little girls
and running as fast as she could when suddenly
something hit her hard and everything
turned black.</p>

<p>The next Dora knew she was lying flat on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the soft grass and Lucy was holding her hand
and one of the big girls was putting water on
her face. And ever so many girls were standing
around and looking at her.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Dora.
“What hit me?”</p>

<p>“You and Marion Baker ran into each
other,” said the big girl who was mopping her
face.</p>

<p>Dora thought this odd. She had not even
<em>seen</em> Marion. How queer that she could run
into a person whom she didn’t see!</p>

<p>The next second Dora discovered that her
lip was cut and bleeding. It hurt worse than
her head and the blood was dropping on the
pretty blue dress which had been so fresh and
clean that morning.</p>

<p>When the littler girls saw the blood-stains,
they were frightened. Some of them ran to
tell Miss Leger that Dora was hurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Leger came out at once. She bathed
Dora’s lip and found that there was only a
small cut. It was very small to produce so
many drops of blood. She told Dora to hold
the wet cloth against it. Then she looked at
Marion, who had a big bump on her forehead.</p>

<p>For a time both Dora and Marion felt very
sorry for themselves, but in a few minutes
Marion’s head stopped aching and Dora’s lip
no longer shed bright drops of blood. They
could even think it funny that with all that
big school-yard, both should have tried to stand
in the same place at the same second.</p>

<p>Lucy was disturbed about Dora’s dress. It
looked worse than Dora could see. Mother
was shopping and would not be at home until
afternoon school was over. Lucy did not know
what was best to do about the dress.</p>

<p>Luckily Father knew. He was sorry that
Dora’s lip was cut, but glad she was not badly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
hurt. He said that Dora had better take off
the dress and put it to soak in cold water. He
was sure that cold water would not hurt it and
that it would be safe to leave it soaking until
Mother came and decided what should be done
to it next. He asked Dora if she did not have
another clean dress.</p>

<p>Yes, there was a clean dress, but not perfectly
new, like the blue gingham. Dora was
sorry to change, but she saw that even a dress
which wasn’t brand-new looked more tidy than
one dribbled with red spots. She took off the
spotted one and Lucy buttoned the other and
they went back to school.</p>

<p>When they were through at four, Mrs. Merrill
was at home. She had attended to the blue
gingham and it was hanging on the line, just
as clean as ever. Of course she wanted to
know about the spots.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora told her about them and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Dora asked anxiously if Mother found the note
in her purse and if she remembered to buy the
canvas and the colored cottons.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill had remembered. There was
a piece of canvas and two shades of green cotton
and two of pink. They had cost seventeen
cents.</p>

<p>Dora ran to bring Mother her quarter, for
she wanted to pay for them so that her gift to
Aunt Margaret should be entirely hers. Mrs.
Merrill gave her eight cents in change.</p>

<p>“And will you fix the top of the cushion so
I can begin on it right away?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I can’t do it just this minute,” said Mrs.
Merrill, “because I have to cook something for
supper. I will try to do it early this evening.”</p>

<p>“Dora and I will wash the dishes and do all
the clearing away, so you can have plenty of
time,” offered Lucy.</p>

<p>After supper, Mrs. Merrill sat down with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the pattern and the cross-stitch canvas and the
linen for the cushion top. She measured and
planned carefully. She basted the canvas in
the proper place so it could not slip while Dora
was working. She made one cross-stitch so
Dora could start easily.</p>

<p>When the last dish was put away, Dora
came eagerly to see the cushion. From the one
stitch Mother had set, it was easy to follow the
pattern and she sat down at once to sew. Before
bedtime, the roses and their leaves were
made and she was ready to pull out the canvas.</p>

<p>Mother showed her how to do this, just one
thread at a time. They were stiff and hurt her
fingers, but she kept on and soon the linen top
with its design of roses lay before her.</p>

<p>“You have done the pretty part now,” said
Mrs. Merrill. “The rest will be plain sewing,
but you must set every stitch as well as you
possibly can. I want Miss Chandler to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that you work neatly. I will baste it for
you.”</p>

<p>“I will try very hard,” said Dora. “I suppose
I couldn’t begin that part this evening?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Merrill. “Tell Father
good-night, and then you and Lucy run up to
bed. When you are ready, knock on the floor
and I will come and put out the light.”</p>

<p>Both Lucy and Dora laughed at forgetful
Mother. Almost always she said that when
they were going to bed. It <em>sounded</em> all right
any time, and it <em>was</em> all right in winter, when
there really was a light to put out. But in
September, with daylight-saving time, there
was twilight when they went to bed. What
Mother meant was that she would come and
kiss them and see that the window was open
and their clothes properly picked up.</p>

<p>Next day Dora back-stitched the case for the
cushion and filled it with some old knitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
wool which she snipped into tiny pieces. Dora
was surprised to learn from Mother that pins
stick much better into a cushion stuffed with
wool. It is no use to stuff one with cotton.</p>

<p>Next, the embroidered top was pressed, and
this Dora did herself after Mother had finished
ironing. Mother basted the top and bottom
together and Dora sewed the edges over and
over. She tried so hard to make the stitches
even and small that her cheeks grew pink and
she felt hot all over. Into each stitch she sewed
a loving thought for Miss Chandler.</p>

<p>When the cushion was done, Mother said
that it looked very neat and Lucy thought it
was beautiful. She liked it so much that Dora
had another idea. If Mother would help her,
she would make a second cushion for Lucy’s
Christmas present. There was plenty of cotton
for more roses and there were canvas and
linen, too. Perhaps it might be possible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
make one for Olive. To make three pretty
gifts and have them cost but seventeen cents
would be a good deal for a little girl to accomplish.</p>

<p>Dora could hardly wait until Lucy left the
room before asking Mother about the other
cushions. Mrs. Merrill said at once that she
would help. They would be desirable Christmas
presents for both Lucy and Olive.</p>

<p>Dora found a clean empty candy-box into
which the cushion fitted exactly. She wrapped
it neatly in tissue paper and put in a card so
Miss Chandler would know from whom it
came.</p>

<p>“You might tell her that you made it yourself,”
suggested Mother, who was now darning
Uncle Dan’s socks.</p>

<p>So Dora put on the card: “I made it myself.”
Then she thought a moment and wrote
some more: “All but one stitch which Mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
made so I could get the roses in the middle.
And the bastings. She sewed those, but they
are all pulled out.”</p>

<p>Mother smiled a little over Dora’s card, but
she said that it would do, and that she thought
Dora was improving in her writing. Then
Dora wrapped the box in brown paper and directed
it to Miss Chandler in Boston. She decided
to pay the postage with her eight cents.
Then there would be nothing about the gift not
wholly hers.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">DORA’S BIRTHDAY</span></h2>

<p>The seventeenth of September was
Dora’s birthday. On Thursday night
she went to bed expecting to feel quite
different when she waked in the morning and
was nine instead of eight. But she didn’t. She
felt just the same.</p>

<p>The day was bright and sunny but cold.
Lucy looked out to see whether there had been
a frost. So far as she could see, nothing was
touched in the garden. Even the nasturtiums,
which get discouraged and turn black if the
thermometer casts a glance toward the freezing-point,
were looking as alert and cheerful as
usual.</p>

<p>When the children were dressed, they ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
down-stairs. Lucy went into the kitchen to
help Mother. Dora sat down in the parlor
and tried to read. The birthday girl never
helped about breakfast. She didn’t even come
near the table till she was called.</p>

<p>Dora simply couldn’t read. She knew there
was to be a surprise and she wanted to think
how pleasant it would be. Out in the kitchen
she could hear Lucy whispering to Mother and
then came a rustle of paper as though somebody
was arranging soft packages.</p>

<p>“Breakfast is ready,” called Lucy at last.
“All right for you to come, Dora.”</p>

<p>Dora didn’t need to be called but once. Nobody
does on a birthday morning.</p>

<p>She saw that her plate was covered with
bundles, and then she had to hide because
Uncle Dan said that her nose must be buttered
and that she should have nine spanks, and one
to grow on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Dora had to dodge around the table till
Mother told Uncle Dan to sit down and behave
properly. Uncle Dan put down the butter-knife
and Dora let him catch her and give her
ten love pats and a big hug.</p>

<p>Then Father kissed her, and Mother said if
they wasted any more time the children would
be late for school and Father and Uncle Dan
would be late for work.</p>

<p>Dora sat down at her place and picked up
the first package. It was fat and not a bit
heavy. She opened it to find some yarn,
soft, and of the prettiest blue you can
imagine. Dora didn’t know it, but it was the
color of her eyes.</p>

<p>“That is to make you a sweater,” said
Mother. “I am going to knit one like Mary
Burton’s. You said you liked hers so much.”</p>

<p>Dora was delighted. She kissed Mother and
looked very happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“My old sweater is growing so small,” she
said. “Will you knit it soon, Mother?”</p>

<p>“I will begin it this evening,” said Mrs.
Merrill. “I want some work to pick up after
supper.”</p>

<p>“It is the color I like best,” said Dora, and
she opened another package.</p>

<p>This was from Olive and it contained two
new hair-ribbons. One was blue and exactly
matched the sweater yarn. The other was
pink. Dora liked them both.</p>

<p>The next package was small and heavy and
Dora wondered what it could be. It was a
paint-box with paints of all the different colors
that any picture could possibly need. This
was from Uncle Dan, and Dora went straight
and hugged him.</p>

<p>“How did you know I wanted a paint-box?”
she asked. “I wanted it very much and
I didn’t expect to have one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“A little bird told me,” said Dan promptly.</p>

<p>“I guess it was an Olive-bird,” laughed
Dora. “I don’t remember telling anybody
but Olive how much I wanted one.”</p>

<p>Lucy was eager for Dora to open her gift.
Dora thought it was lovely. It was a roll of
colored papers and paper lace, for making hats
and dresses for paper dolls. Such a gift was
most desirable for work on winter evenings.</p>

<p>Now two packages were left, one of which
had come through the mail. Dora opened the
other first. This was from Father and was a
copy of “Alice in Wonderland.”</p>

<p>Dora loved that story. She had borrowed
it many times from the Public Library and
never expected to have a copy of her own. Father
explained that he had a chance to buy it
through the printing-press and knew she
would like it.</p>

<p>“There is another part to my present,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
said. “Next week there is to be a good film
at the movies, ‘Anne of Green Gables.’
You and Lucy and Mother are to see the afternoon
performance.”</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora both had to hug Father now.
It was not often that Mother let them go to
the movie theatre. She thought the pictures
were not as nice as books. It would be great
fun to see “Anne,” and all the more fun to
know about it so long before.</p>

<p>Now there was one package left to open, but
under it were two post-cards and a letter. One
card was from Mr. Thorne, the rector of the
church where the Merrills went and where
Uncle Dan sang in the choir. The other was
from Miss Page, Dora’s Sunday school
teacher. Both had remembered to send a
birthday greeting.</p>

<p>The letter and the package were from Miss
Chandler. Dora took off the outer wrapper of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the package and found a candy-box, much like
the one her pincushion had gone traveling in.
But no candy, unless made of sea-foam, could
be so light as that box. When she opened it,
nothing showed but tissue paper.</p>

<p>Very carefully, Dora pulled this out and in
the middle, wrapped in bright red paper so she
could not fail to see it, was a small box, tied
with white ribbon. When she opened it Dora
gave a gasp. She was so surprised that she
could not speak.</p>

<p>Inside the box was a little thing rolled in
cotton, and when Dora’s trembling fingers took
it out, it was another charm for her to wear on
her silver chain.</p>

<p>This charm was a tiny kitten, about three-quarters
of an inch high. Unless it had upset
a blueing bottle, no earthly kitten was ever that
color. This one was deep blue, and it didn’t
seem to be made either of glass or metal. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
pointed ears gave it a surprised look and its
kitten face wore a pleasant expression. About
its neck was a silver collar with a ring at the
back to slip on a chain. About its feet its tail
coiled tight as though to keep its paws from
scattering. Anybody could see that it was an
unusual kitten. Dora felt sure it must have a
story.</p>

<p>“The letter is from Miss Chandler,” said
Mother. “If you open it, Dora, it may tell
you where the little cat came from. I suppose
it is something she brought from Europe.”</p>

<p>The kitten had come from even farther than
Europe! Dora read the letter aloud.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Little Dora</span>:</p>

<p>“Many happy returns of your birthday!
I hope you may have the nicest possible
time. I am sorry Arcturus was so ungrateful
as to run away from his kind mistress, but you
know bears are wild at heart. I am sending
you another pet in his place, one which I hope
will be willing to stay at home. This is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Chinese kitten which came from the city of
Hong Kong. If you drop it, it will not break
because it is made of stained ivory.</p>

<p>“Since you named your bear for a star, perhaps
you may like a star name for this kitten.
Would you like to call it Vega? That is the
name of a brilliant star which in summer is almost
directly overhead. I am sure your uncle
will help you find it. It is a star which shines
with a blue light, so its name is suited to a blue
kitten.”</p>

</div>

<p>Dora was delighted that the blue kitten
should be named for a blue star. She stopped
to say so before finishing the letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I wanted to spend our birthday together,
but I have to teach all day. So I made another
plan which Mother will tell you.”</p>

</div>

<p>Dora at once turned to Mother. “I will tell
you when you have eaten your porridge,” said
Mrs. Merrill. “Your breakfast is getting
cold, Dora. Eat your oatmeal and drink your
milk.”</p>

<p>“No eat—no go,” said Uncle Dan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dan, keep still,” said Mrs. Merrill. “Begin
to eat, Dora.”</p>

<p>Dora was too happy to feel hungry, but she
knew the oatmeal must go down and that she
must eat an egg and a slice of toast. When
she had almost finished, Mrs. Merrill told the
plan.</p>

<p>“I had a letter, too, from Miss Chandler,”
she said. “She has invited you and Lucy to
come into Boston to-morrow morning and stay
with her until Sunday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Mother! May we?” exclaimed Lucy and
Dora in one breath.</p>

<p>“I never went to Boston but twice in my
life,” said Lucy.</p>

<p>“I never visited anybody over night,” said
Dora and then they both said, “Mother, <em>do</em>
let us!”</p>

<p>“Father and I are willing you should go,”
replied Mrs. Merrill. “Miss Chandler sent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
dollar to pay for your tickets, and Father will
put you on the eight o’clock train and Miss
Chandler will meet you in the North Station.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know Aunt Margaret kept
house,” said Lucy.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a real house,” said Mrs. Merrill,
“that is, not like this one. She has some rooms
in a big building.”</p>

<p>“Mother!” said Dora, “oh, Mother, may
I take Aunt Margaret a piece of my birthday
cake?”</p>

<p>“How do you know there will be a birthday
cake?” asked Mrs. Merrill.</p>

<p>“Because there always is,” said Dora.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">ABOUT BOSTON</span></h2>

<p>You may be sure that Lucy and Dora
did not oversleep next morning. For
supper there had been pink ice-cream
and a proper birthday cake with nine pink
candles, and the holiday feeling lasted all
night.</p>

<p>Father took them to the station and put
them on the train. He spoke to the conductor
and then to Lucy.</p>

<p>“Now, Lucy,” he said, “if Miss Chandler is
not on the platform where the train comes in,
you and Dora are to walk right back to the
car where you got off, and this gentleman will
bring you home on his next train.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, Father,” said Dora, “Aunt Margaret
will be there. She <em>said</em> she would meet
us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Father, “and I think
she will be waiting. This is so you will know
what to do if anything happens to prevent her
being there.”</p>

<p>Father kissed them and the conductor
said, “All aboard!” Father stepped off
quickly.</p>

<p>Neither Lucy nor Dora often went on a
train. They traveled so seldom that it was
great fun to see the farmhouses and cows and
hens as the train scurried past, and to watch
the telegraph poles swooping down to gather
up their wires.</p>

<p>Before long, the farms grew fewer, and the
houses came closer together and instead of having
only two tracks, one for the trains going
to Boston and the other for trains going in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
opposite direction, there were many tracks on
both sides, with engines puffing past or cars
standing in long lines.</p>

<p>Quite soon the trainman came and took their
suit-case. Lucy looked at it anxiously for it
contained a clean white dress for her and one
for Dora. These were to be worn on Sunday
if Aunt Margaret wished to take them to
church. Lucy was not sure what the man
meant to do with the suit-case.</p>

<p>Dora did not notice his taking it. The train
was moving across a bridge with water coming
quite close on either side. In the air, gulls
were flying, and in the distance she could see
some big ships.</p>

<p>The trainman saw that Lucy looked troubled.
“The conductor told me to take this,”
he said. “I’ll go with you to meet the party
you are looking for.”</p>

<p>Lucy didn’t know what he meant. “But we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
aren’t going to a party,” she said shyly. “We
are going to meet Aunt Margaret.”</p>

<p>The trainman smiled. “I’ll help you meet
her,” he said, and he looked so pleasant that
Lucy was willing he should take the suit-case.</p>

<p>When the train stopped, the children followed
the other people to the door and there
the trainman stood with the suit-case. He
lifted Dora down and took Lucy by the elbow
to help her just as he did the grown-up ladies.
Then he walked with them down a long platform.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora were glad that he came with
them. The train was standing under a big
shed with a very high roof and many people
were hurrying about. Huge engines snorted
and made so much noise that it seemed most
confusing.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler stood by the gate which let
the people through from the train-shed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
other part of the station. She kissed the little
girls and thanked the kind trainman for helping
them find her.</p>

<p>The first thing was to dispose of the suit-case.
Miss Chandler called a messenger-boy
and sent him to take it to her rooms.</p>

<p>“Now,” she said to the children, “we will go
by the elevated train.”</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora had read about the elevated
railways in big cities, but neither had been on
one. They went through the big station and
up some steps and through a turnstile and
along a corridor above a street where the
trucks and electric cars were, and up some
more steps to a platform. Soon a train of cars
came, but it did not have a smoky engine. This
train ran by electricity.</p>

<p>“Is this the evelated train?” asked Dora.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is the elevated,” said Miss Chandler,
laughing. “We will step into this car.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>In half a minute the train was again moving,
but the children were surprised because it did
not stay on the tracks above the street. Instead,
it promptly plunged underground, into
a lighted tunnel which ran under the street instead
of above it.</p>

<p>“It is a funny kind of elevated train which
runs underground, isn’t it?” said Miss Chandler.
“But it does in Boston.”</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora thought it was odd, but they
liked the brightly lighted stations where the
train stopped. Quite soon, Miss Chandler said
they would get out.</p>

<p>When they left the car they were still underground
and climbed many stairs before seeing
daylight. When they came out, it was on
a sidewalk in the midst of tall buildings, much
higher than any in the city where Mother went
shopping. The streets were very narrow and
at almost every crossing stood a policeman. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
told the automobiles to stop and let people
cross the street, or he told the people to wait on
the sidewalk until it was safe for them to come.
Everybody did exactly what he told them to
do.</p>

<p>“I think it is very kind of that policeman to
stand there and help the people,” said Dora.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler smiled. “Do you, Dora?”
she asked. “He says we may cross now.”</p>

<p>Such wonderful shop-windows! Lucy and
Dora were really obliged to stop and look, for
they had never imagined anything so beautiful.
One big window was draped with silks of different
shades of orange and flame.</p>

<p>“Is it a fairy palace?” asked Dora. “It is
like a story I read once.”</p>

<p>No, it was not a palace, only a big shop and
people could go in and buy those very silks if
they liked. Miss Chandler let the children look
in a number of windows and then she called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
their attention to an open space across the
street.</p>

<p>“Let us go over on the Common,” she said.
“Perhaps the squirrels will come to be
fed.”</p>

<p>Directly across from the beautiful shops was
a big park with great elms and green grass and
seats where men and women were sitting.
When the children entered, they saw three fat
gray squirrels with bushy tails climbing over
a man who sat on one of the seats.</p>

<p>“They know he has nuts for them,” said
Miss Chandler.</p>

<p>The man saw the children looking at him.
He drew his hand from his pocket and it contained
some peanuts.</p>

<p>“Would you like to feed the squirrels?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Will they bite?” asked Lucy.</p>

<p>“Not if you don’t scare them. Don’t touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
them nor try to grab them, but just hold the
nut in your fingers.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Lucy and took one nut.</p>

<p>“May we?” Dora asked Miss Chandler, and
when she smiled, Dora took a nut and thanked
the man.</p>

<p>The squirrels came at once. Dora shivered a
little when her squirrel put its paws about her
fingers to steady the nut. Its wee hands felt
so queer!</p>

<p>The third squirrel sat on the man’s knee and
nibbled a peanut. When it was eaten, it put its
paws over its heart in a beseeching way. As
well as it knew how, it was begging for another.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was lucky that the man did not
have many peanuts, for Lucy and Dora would
have stayed until they were all gone. When
there were no more, they thanked the man
again and followed Miss Chandler across the
Common.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who takes care of the squirrels in the
winter?” asked Lucy. “Who would feed
them if the people didn’t?”</p>

<p>“The park commissioners feed them,” said
Miss Chandler. “Did you know that the
State legislature of Massachusetts once
stopped some important work to provide for a
family of orphan gray squirrels on Boston
Common?”</p>

<p>“Did they really?” asked Lucy.</p>

<p>“They really did. So you see that the
squirrels would be looked after even if people
didn’t like to feed them with peanuts. Did you
ever hear of the Frog Pond?”</p>

<p>“I have,” said Lucy eagerly. “I have just
studied about it in my history class. Dora
hasn’t had history yet, but we can tell her.”</p>

<p>Dora looked at the small pond before them.
She didn’t see any frogs.</p>

<p>“Just think, Dora,” said Miss Chandler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
“that pond has been here since the first people
came to Boston. The boys always slide on it
in winter. Once during the Revolutionary
War, British soldiers camped on the Common.
They spoiled the ice where the children wanted
to slide.”</p>

<p>“I know what happened,” said Lucy
proudly. “The general in command of the
British army was a very cross man, but the
boys didn’t care if he was. They went
straight and told him what the soldiers had
done. And the General said they were to let
the slide alone. Didn’t he, Aunt Margaret?”</p>

<p>“He did,” said Miss Chandler.</p>

<p>Dora looked respectfully at the Frog Pond.
There were better places in Westmore for
sliding when winter came, but it was interesting
to know that children had played with the
Frog Pond ever since there were any children
in Boston to play there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond the Common lay a pretty park,
called the Public Garden, and here they came
to a larger body of water with white birds
swimming on it. Some were ducks and some
were swans, and the children stopped to watch
them. Miss Chandler kept looking at a
wooden platform not far away. Part of
it was on the bank and part floated on the
water.</p>

<p>Presently a boat came in sight, but it was
like no boat Lucy and Dora had ever seen. It
was not like the launch on World’s End Pond
nor like the one at the beach. It looked like
a tremendous great bird, floating lightly on the
water.</p>

<p>“Would you like to go in the swan boat?”
asked Miss Chandler.</p>

<p>Would they like to! Dora and Lucy could
hardly speak for joy. But Dora asked one
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“There won’t be any waves, will there?”
she inquired anxiously. “Not to tip the swan
about?”</p>

<p>“It will be perfectly smooth,” said Miss
Chandler, and it was. Dora enjoyed every
second she spent in the swan boat.</p>

<p>Next, Miss Chandler took them to the Boston
Public Library. The children were very
fond of the library in Westmore, but they had
never imagined a library as big as this great
building. Miss Chandler told them that Boston
was a large city and the people needed
many books to read.</p>

<p>They stayed a long time in the Public Library.
In it were many rooms and in some
were beautiful paintings. To see them, they
climbed a marble stair where great lions kept
guard. Dora at once revised her ideas of fairy
palaces. If only that windowful of silks could
be hung on the walls of the marble stair, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
would be better than any palace of which she
had read.</p>

<p>On the walls of one room were paintings
about Sir Galahad. Lucy and Dora knew his
story and how he went to seek the Holy Grail.
Miss Chandler explained each painting.</p>

<p>Then she took them into a pleasant room
with low bookcases and small tables and chairs
and told them that it belonged to the children
of Boston. All the books on the shelves were
books which children liked to read.</p>

<p>Dora looked at the shelves carefully. It
would be nice to have a library just for children,
with no grown-ups at all. Still, the
Westmore library was nice, and a little town
didn’t need a big library like Boston. Some of
the books she saw on the shelves were in the
children’s corner of the Westmore library.</p>

<p>“Now I think it is time for luncheon,” said
Miss Chandler. “We will have it rather early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
because I have a plan for this afternoon and I
don’t want you to get too tired.”</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora had not thought about eating,
but now it was mentioned, they both felt
hungry.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler stopped an electric car near
the library. To the amusement of the children,
after running a few blocks down a wide
street, the car dived underground. Cars in
Boston seemed to have this habit.</p>

<p>When they came out of the subway they
were in a different part of town, one which was
crowded with people and had many large
stores.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler took them into one of these
stores and up in an elevator to where there
was a restaurant with music playing.</p>

<p>First they washed their hands and smoothed
their hair and then sat at a pretty round table
with two pink asters in a vase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>In every direction were tables with people
eating luncheon. The waitresses wore gray
linen uniforms and white caps, and boys in
white suits carried away trays of used dishes.
The place was so large and strange that Dora
was glad Miss Chandler was with them.</p>

<p>“What would you like for lunch?” Miss
Chandler asked.</p>

<p>“Ice-cream, please,” said Lucy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” said Dora. “I would like that
best of anything, Aunt Margaret.”</p>

<p>“We will have ice-cream for dessert,” said
Miss Chandler, “but we must eat something
else first.”</p>

<p>Neither Lucy nor Dora cared especially
what they had for lunch. There was too much
to see for them to feel interested in the paper
which had printed on it the things to eat.</p>

<p>“We will have fricasseed chicken and baked
potatoes and rolls,” said Miss Chandler. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
will have some coffee and you girls shall have
milk. Then we will all order ice-cream.”</p>

<p>The luncheon came on pretty dishes and the
chicken was gay with green parsley. The potatoes
sat in white paper boats. Most unusual
of all, each lump of sugar for Miss Chandler’s
coffee came wrapped in smooth white paper.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler said she did not use sugar in
her coffee and that the children might each
have one lump. Lucy ate hers while waiting
for the ice-cream, but Dora tucked hers into a
coat pocket. She thought she would take it to
Mother.</p>

<p>“What is the nice plan for the afternoon,
Aunt Margaret?” Lucy asked when she had
finished her chocolate ice-cream. Dora’s ice-cream
was strawberry and Miss Chandler’s
vanilla.</p>

<p>But the afternoon of that day must have a
chapter to itself.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">SUNDAY AFTERNOON</span></h2>

<p>Of course the Chinese kitten came to
Boston with Dora. To visit Miss
Chandler without wearing her gift
would be rude. Mother took a pair of pliers
and bent the clasp on Dora’s silver chain so
that it unfastened less easily. It must have
come apart while Dora was sleeping, and so
Arcturus found a chance to escape. Mother
made sure that Vega could not get away.</p>

<p>Dora was holding the dear kitten in one hand
while Miss Chandler explained her afternoon
plan. They were to see “Jack and the Beanstalk.”
This was a play, not a film picture,
but a most unusual play, because it was acted,
not by real people, but by dolls!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Lucy and Dora both opened their eyes wide.
How could dolls act a play? They had sometimes
tried to have a play with their dolls, but
the stupid things would not take any interest.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler explained that these dolls
were called marionettes. All any one could see
was the stage with the marionettes giving the
play, but they were really worked by strings
attached to their jointed arms and legs. These
strings went up above the stage and were
pulled by people out of sight.</p>

<p>A great many children came to see the
marionettes and Lucy and Dora enjoyed looking
about at all the little girls and boys.</p>

<p>When the curtain rose, showing Jack and
his mother and their cottage, they could
scarcely believe that the figures, or puppets,
were only dolls. They looked the right size
for people. They walked about easily and
rapidly. It was possible to understand just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
what they were saying, or rather, what the
people behind the scenes were saying for
them.</p>

<p>How all the children laughed when the cow
galloped clumsily in! A frisky cow she was,
for she tossed her horns and kicked up her heels
when Jack tried to catch her. And then he
sold her for the magic bean and planted it,
while his mother scolded him and wept.</p>

<p>The magic bean began to grow! Away it
went up past the top of the stage, and away
went Jack, climbing the stalk while his mother
wrung her hands and begged him to come back.</p>

<p>Lucy liked the giant and his wife, but Dora
never cared for that part of the story. She
was glad when the giants were done with and
Jack brought home the gold and chopped
down the uncanny beanstalk.</p>

<p>There followed a second play, and this time
the actors were cunning rabbits with pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
ears and furry faces. They wore gingham
dresses or trousers and acted much like real
boys and girls.</p>

<p>All over the theatre the children laughed
aloud when a naughty boy rabbit got himself
wet and Mother Rabbit hung him to dry on a
line behind the kitchen stove. But it was the
grown-ups who laughed when the postman
came with a letter, for the postman was a turtle,
and turtles, you know, never move very
fast.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora enjoyed every minute.
They could have watched the marionettes for
hours and were sorry when it was over.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler knew some of the people who
managed the puppets, so she took the children
behind the scenes. They were astonished to
find that Jack was a small doll, and that the
giant was only as large as Lucy’s biggest one.
Because everything on the stage was made just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the proper size for the puppets, it seemed as
though they were really as large as living people.</p>

<p>The girls who managed the puppets were
dressed in knickerbockers and stood on planks
raised above the stage. One of them showed
Lucy and Dora exactly how she held Jack,
and how by pulling one string or another, she
could make him walk across the stage, or raise
his arms, or turn his head. It seemed wonderful
to the children, and, indeed, it <em>was</em> wonderful.</p>

<p>After the play they ate supper at a place
called a dairy lunch, with nice milk and butter
and white shiny tiled walls. But here there
was no music.</p>

<p>“Now we will go home,” said Miss Chandler.
“I am sure you have seen enough for
to-day.”</p>

<p>Another electric car took them where Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Chandler lived. On the fifth floor of a tall
building, she had three rooms which were
called an apartment. The first was a living-room,
with a big table and a lamp and comfortable
chairs and many books. There was
one bedroom and a tiny bathroom with a tub
for short people. Lastly was a sort of cupboard
where there was a gas plate and some
pretty dishes. This, Miss Chandler said, was
called a kitchenette, because it was too small to
be a real kitchen.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora were pleased with this name.
They knew now that they had used a kitchenette
at the beach.</p>

<p>The suit-case was there before them and on
Miss Chandler’s bureau was the rosebud
cushion. She had liked it very much.</p>

<p>The children were tired enough to go to bed
early, but they did wonder where they were to
sleep, for the bedroom contained only one bed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and it was altogether too narrow for more
than one person. Three would be a tight
fit.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler moved some books from the
mantel in the living-room. She pulled a knob.
The whole front of the mantel came down and
there was a deep box with a mattress.</p>

<p>“This is a folding-bed,” said Miss Chandler.
“Did you ever sleep in one?”</p>

<p>“Never,” said Dora.</p>

<p>“Will it shut up while we are in it?” asked
Lucy doubtfully.</p>

<p>“It can’t do that,” said Miss Chandler.
She showed them a bolt which kept the bed
from shutting until the proper time in the
morning. Even if at heart it wanted to close,
it couldn’t until the people were ready to put
it away.</p>

<p>Miss Chandler brought sheets and blankets,
and in five minutes a comfortable bed was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
ready for two tired little girls. Soon they
were tucked into it.</p>

<p>“I shall be reading in my bedroom for a
while,” said Miss Chandler. “If you want
anything, just speak to me.”</p>

<p>Miss Chandler expected that the children
would talk for a time, but they did not. Lucy
was sleepy and Dora had so much to think
about that she didn’t feel like talking. Very
soon Lucy was asleep.</p>

<p>Dora watched the wind blow the sash curtain
before the open window and then she suddenly
discovered a strange thing. It was exactly
like a bright round eye on the wall near the
door.</p>

<p>Dora looked at it hard, and the longer she
looked, the less she liked it. How could a person
or an animal with one eye be staring at her
in the dark? How could any eye shine like
that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Dora tucked the Chinese kitten under her
cheek for comfort and tried not to look at the
queer eye. She looked toward the table where
the pretty lamp stood.</p>

<p>That direction wasn’t pleasant either. She
saw another queer thing, a streak of light this
time, which seemed in the middle of the air.
It was a thin, short streak, much nearer the
folding-bed than the eye on the wall.</p>

<p>Dora hid her face in her pillow and tried to
think what these queer things might be, but the
longer she thought, the worse they seemed.
She turned her head, and there was the round
bright eye on the wall. She looked toward the
table, and there was the streak of light in a
place where no streak ought to be.</p>

<p>Dora sat up in bed and saw a line of light
under Miss Chandler’s door. That was a
right and proper place for it to be. She got
up and put her arm across her face so she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
should not see the queer eye as she passed.
She knocked on the door.</p>

<p>It opened instantly and when Miss Chandler
saw Dora, she took her in her arms.
“Why, honey, what is the matter?” she asked.
“Can’t you go to sleep?”</p>

<p>For a minute Dora did not say anything.
She was contented just to feel loving arms
about her.</p>

<p>“There is a <em>very</em> queer thing in that room,
Aunt Margaret,” she said at last, her head on
Miss Chandler’s shoulder. “I don’t like
it at all and I don’t think it ought to be
there.”</p>

<p>“What is it, darling?” asked Miss Chandler.</p>

<p>“It is a round bright eye on the wall,” explained
Dora. “It looks at me in the dark.
And by the table is a little shiny streak.”</p>

<p>Miss Chandler gave a soft laugh and hugged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Dora tight. “Would you be afraid of that
eye if you saw it with me?” she asked.</p>

<p>Dora said she would not feel afraid. Miss
Chandler put out the light in her bedroom. In
half a minute, right by the door, out of the
darkness grew a shiny round spot, exactly like
the one in the living-room.</p>

<p>“You see it, don’t you, dear?” asked Miss
Chandler. “Now, we will put on the light.”</p>

<p>When the room was bright with electricity,
Miss Chandler took Dora over to the wall
where the eye had shone. There was an electric
switch with two push-buttons. One was
white and one was black.</p>

<p>“It is this button, Dora,” said Miss Chandler.
“The top has been painted with something
which shines in the dark. It isn’t an
evil eye at all, little Dora, but a nice friendly
eye that says, ‘Did you want to put on the
electric light? Here am I, showing you just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
where to touch your finger and snap it on in
a jiffy!’”</p>

<p>Miss Chandler turned out the light and
Dora saw the button begin to shine. She
pushed it in and out and saw how nice it was
to have a bright eye to tell her where to find the
switch.</p>

<p>“And the streak by the table?” she asked.</p>

<p>“That is a bit of radium paint enclosed in a
glass pendant. When you pull the pendant,
the lamp on the table lights.”</p>

<p>Dora gave a sigh of relief. “Thank you,
Aunt Margaret,” she said. “We have gas at
home, and after Mother turns it off, nothing
shines.”</p>

<p>Miss Chandler tucked Dora again into bed.
When Dora was alone in the dark, she could
smile at the friendly eye on the wall.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning the children had the
fun of getting breakfast in the kitchenette.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
First, the folding-bed had to be whisked out of
the way, and the room aired and straightened.</p>

<p>There was a wee refrigerator about as large
as Mother’s cake-box. In it were butter and
milk, a jar of cream, and a comb of honey. A
paper bag held crisp half-moon rolls, and there
was also a tumbler of orange marmalade.
Miss Chandler made coffee for herself, and
Lucy proudly boiled three eggs exactly four
minutes. She knew just how, because she
often cooked them for Mother.</p>

<p>After breakfast they went to church, wearing
the white dresses. It was fortunate that
Mother thought to send an extra dress apiece,
for though the gingham dresses were still
clean, they were rumpled after all the exciting
things that happened on Saturday.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful church to which Miss
Chandler took them, big and dark, with windows
like rainbows, and an organ which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
sounded like heaven. The service was like
that in the Westmore church. Dora wished
Uncle Dan were with her, for he liked music
and the Westmore choir could not sing like
this one.</p>

<p>After service, Miss Chandler showed the
children the statue of Bishop Brooks outside
the church and told them how good a man he
was, and how people loved him so much that
the whole city of Boston mourned for him
when he died, even people who didn’t go to his
church. Long years ago he used to preach
there in Trinity Church.</p>

<p>“We are going to do a very interesting
thing this afternoon,” Miss Chandler said while
they were eating dinner at the College Club.
The Club was only a pleasant house, and there
was ice-cream for dessert, which was important.</p>

<p>“Will it be a surprise?” asked Dora.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think you will be much surprised,” said
Miss Chandler.</p>

<p>After the ice-cream was eaten, they walked
through a parkway and before long went into
a large building.</p>

<p>Inside was a room where a lady wearing a
white dress and a white cap sat at a desk. Miss
Chandler told the children to sit down and she
talked with this lady. A bell rang somewhere.</p>

<p>Presently in came another lady, dressed in
the same way as the one at the desk, but she
was much younger. Miss Chandler spoke to
her and then came to the children.</p>

<p>“This is Lucy and this is Dora,” she said.
“This lady is Miss Perrin, and she is going to
show us something interesting.”</p>

<p>Miss Perrin took them into a broad hall and
to an elevator which went up so slowly that the
children could see on every floor they passed,
more ladies dressed in white, or in blue with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
white caps and aprons, and men, too, who,
strange to say, wore white coats and trousers.</p>

<p>Dora looked inquiringly at Miss Chandler.
She smiled back. There was a queer smell in
the air. It smelled almost like Mr. Giddings’
drug-store. Miss Perrin left the elevator and
led the way to a door.</p>

<p>The room beyond was unlike anything the
children had ever seen. The bare floor looked
as though it were washed every hour, it was so
<em>fearfully</em> clean! Not a picture hung on the
straw-colored walls. All the woodwork was
white and the table had a glass top. There
were only two chairs, and <em>they</em> were white.
You can never guess the rest of the furniture.</p>

<p>All around three sides of the room white
baskets stood on tall white frames, and in every
basket lay a tiny, tiny baby. A whole room
full of babies and no grown people at all!</p>

<p>Miss Perrin went straight to the nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
basket. “O dear!” she said. “Those doctors
are so careless. They are forever coming
and unpinning covers. Then these persons
kick off their blankets and take cold. This
one’s hands are freezing.”</p>

<p>Such a very little person to kick off blankets!
But they were in a heap at the bottom of the
basket and the baby was crying real tears.
Dora could hardly bear to see them on its tiny
cheeks and to see how pitifully its lower lip
quivered. Miss Perrin took it up and laid it
against her warm cheek and it stopped being
pitiful. Then she tucked it in and pinned down
the covers. It did not cry again.</p>

<p>“That is all men know about babies,” said
Miss Perrin. “I don’t mind the doctors looking
at them, but they never leave them as they
find them. No man knows how to put one to
bed.”</p>

<p>Miss Perrin looked at every baby to be sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
no careless doctor had left it to kick off its
covers.</p>

<p>“I have a friend who is here in the hospital,”
said Miss Chandler. “I want to see her for a
few minutes. Would you two like to stay with
the babies? Which is Mrs. Stoddard’s baby?”</p>

<p>“This person here,” said Miss Perrin, indicating
a crib. “She is five days old.”</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora went to look at the friend’s
baby. It was sound asleep.</p>

<p>While Miss Chandler went to see Mrs.
Stoddard, Lucy and Dora looked at all the
babies. Then Miss Perrin took them into
another and much larger room. Even this big
room was full of babies.</p>

<p>They were not sleeping in bassinets like
those in the smaller room, but their beds were
just as comfortable. Each one lay on a mattress
in a wire basket which looked something
like Mother’s dish-drainer. When a nurse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
wanted a special baby, she picked it up, basket
and all, and carried it off.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room was an odd table,
with wheels and two shelves. One of the
nurses was collecting wire baskets, each with a
wee baby. She set the baskets side by side on
the shelves of the table. When there was room
for no more, she wheeled the table and the
babies into the corridor.</p>

<p>“They are going to their mothers,” said
Miss Perrin. “The mothers are in another
room and it is time the babies were fed.”</p>

<p>“How do they know which baby belongs to
which mother?” asked Dora. “There are so
many that I should think they would get
mixed.”</p>

<p>“No, they are never mixed,” said Miss Perrin.
“We are careful about that, for of course
each mother prefers her own baby.”</p>

<p>Miss Perrin lifted the blanket of the nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
baby and showed the children a tag fastened to
its dress. On the tag was a number and a
name. The name was that of the mother, and
the number that of her bed.</p>

<p>“Whenever a nurse dresses a baby,” Miss
Perrin explained, “the first thing she does is
to take off this tag and fasten it to the clean
dress. And she mustn’t touch another baby
until the first one is finished. But we also
mark them in another way.”</p>

<p>Miss Perrin uncovered a tiny foot. On its
sole was stuck a piece of cloth plaster with the
mother’s name written on it.</p>

<p>“You see they cannot be mixed,” she said.
“And, anyway, the mothers soon know their
own babies.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Dora agreed.</p>

<p>Lucy gave an exclamation. In one wire
basket lay a baby, no smaller than the others,
for all were small, but different, because it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
a colored baby. Its skin was black and wee
bits of wool covered its head.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it cunning!” said Lucy. “Oh,
Dora, I wish we could have it at our house.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Dora.</p>

<p>Miss Perrin laughed. “I guess Mother
wouldn’t want you to have it,” she said. “Her
name is Blanche, and she is just as good as a
kitten.”</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora could not leave that little
black baby. They liked it best of any, and
when Miss Chandler came back, she found
them by its basket. They talked about it all
the way to Miss Chandler’s apartment, and
while they were packing the suit-case.</p>

<p>“We have had a beautiful time, Aunt Margaret,”
said Lucy, when they were ready to
start for the station.</p>

<p>“Thank you for asking us,” said Dora. “I
think Boston is a very nice place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nice enough to live in?” asked Miss
Chandler.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Dora, and then she stopped.
“If I could live in two places,” she went on,
after thinking a little. “Because Westmore
is home, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Miss Chandler, and
then she kissed Dora. “But you will like to
visit in Boston sometimes?”</p>

<p>“I shall like it very much,” said Dora.
“We will always come when you invite us,
Aunt Margaret. That is, if Mother says we
may.”</p>

<p>“I shall certainly ask you both to come
again,” said Miss Chandler.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE KITTEN’S STORY</span></h2>

<p>When they reached home, both Lucy
and Dora talked a great deal. They
had to tell Father and Mother all
the things they had seen and done in Boston.
Father was especially interested in the marionettes
and asked many questions about them.</p>

<p>Some of the questions the children could not
answer, so Father said that the next time they
went to the Public Library, he wished they
would ask Miss Perkins for a book on marionettes.
Dora said she would do so.</p>

<p>Uncle Dan liked to hear about the church
with the beautiful picture windows and the
wonderful music. He said that once he had
been there to a choir festival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>After a time Father went to see Mr. Baker,
and Uncle Dan took his hat and went out
through the kitchen. Dora ran after him.</p>

<p>“Are you going to see Olive?” she asked.
“Please tell her that I <em>love</em> my new ribbons.
And tell her I have been in Boston and that is
why I haven’t said ‘thank you’ for them.”</p>

<p>Uncle Dan said that he would tell Olive.
Dora went back into the parlor and sat on
Mother’s lap.</p>

<p>“I must tell you about my Chinese kitten,”
she said. “Oh, Mother, Aunt Margaret liked
the piece of birthday cake so much! She said
to tell you she wished she could make cake like
that. She did not have any of her own,
Mother.”</p>

<p>“Next year we will make her a birthday
cake,” said Mrs. Merrill, and she looked
pleased. “What about the Chinese kitten?”</p>

<p>“First of all,” Dora began, “Aunt Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
showed me the star she named it for. Last
night it was very bright, and I can find it now
for Uncle Dan. At least, I <em>think</em> I can. And
then she told me about the kitten.</p>

<p>“When Aunt Margaret’s grandfather,”
Dora went on, “was about as old as Uncle
Dan, he went on a long voyage on a ship that
sailed to China. When he came home, he
brought with him a set of ivory chess-men. Do
you know what they are, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Merrill. “Chess is a
game, played on a board with squares marked
off,—a checker-board, like yours,—and a set
of counters. You and Lucy have counters
for your game of parchesi.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dora, “but those are flat and
round. These chess-men were different.
They stood up tall, and the pieces which
counted most,—the kings and queens and
knights and bishops—were cats, <em>big</em> cats, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
out of ivory. And the littler pieces, the pawns,
were kittens. Half the pieces were white and
half were blue. There were eight blue kittens
and eight white ones.”</p>

<p>“They must have been very pretty,” Mrs.
Merrill agreed. “What became of them?’</p>

<p>“Some were lost,” said Dora, “and Aunt
Margaret thinks her boy cousins took the cats
when they visited their grandmother. So many
chess-men were gone that people couldn’t play
the game any more. The grandmother
thought, since the boys had taken the cats, she
would divide the kittens between the little girl
cousins.</p>

<p>“She gave Aunt Margaret four kittens,”
Dora went on, “two blue ones and two white.”</p>

<p>Dora stopped. Lucy was calling Timothy
at the back door. Dora looked to see that
Lucy was beyond hearing. Even then, she
whispered the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aunt Margaret told me that she is going
to give Lucy a white kitten for Christmas.
You will keep it a secret, won’t you,
Mother?”</p>

<p>“I will try to,” said Mrs. Merrill. “But
what with your pincushion and now this white
kitten, and its being only September, I think
we are getting Lucy’s Christmas started
early.”</p>

<p>“I know she will like it,” said Dora happily.
“I told Aunt Margaret so. In the beginning
the kittens didn’t have anything around their
necks, but Aunt Margaret took Vega to a
jeweler, and had him put on a silver collar and
ring, so I could wear her on my chain. Lucy’s
white kitten will have a collar, too. And that
is why Vega sits down so hard and flat,
Mother, so as not to tip over on the chess-board.”</p>

<p>Next, Dora told Mother about the babies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and how one had cried real tears until Miss
Perrin comforted it. Lucy came back and
they both talked of the little black baby.</p>

<p>“Would you have minded if we had brought
it home?” asked Lucy.</p>

<p>“I should prefer a white one,” said Mother.</p>

<p>“But this was more unusual,” explained
Lucy.</p>

<p>“It would be in our family,” agreed Mrs.
Merrill. Then she said they must go to bed
early, because, after two such exciting days,
she knew they were tired.</p>

<p>Quite soon after Dora’s birthday, Jack
Frost took out his paints and colored all the
leaves. Some were yellow and some red,
mixed with green. Some, he turned a faded
brown. All over Westmore, the leaves began
to flutter down and carpet the streets with
bright spots of color.</p>

<p>Then one night, Jack took a look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
flower-beds. Evidently he didn’t approve of
people’s raising flowers in gardens; he cared
only for things which grew wild. For the
flowers did not become bright colors; they
turned black and shriveled.</p>

<p>Uncle Dan cut down the tall hollyhocks
which had been so pretty all summer. Many of
them towered far above his head. Lucy and
Dora dragged the stalks to a place where they
could be burned. Some of the seeds went into
their hair and some went down their necks.
And hollyhock seeds tickle when they slip inside
one’s clothes.</p>

<p>Mother asked Uncle Dan to trim the rose-bushes
on either side of the back door. She
said she was tired of having them snatch out
her hairpins every time she tried to hang up
clothes. The children thought Mother was
joking, but Uncle Dan cut off one long sprout
and on it, there really sat a hairpin. Dora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
took it straight to Mother who put it in her hair
and said she was glad to see it again.</p>

<p>Dora read “Doctor Dolittle” through five
times. Then she looked once more at every
picture and returned the book to the library,
just as clean and nice as when she took it. She
told Miss Perkins that she liked that story best
of any book she had ever read. Miss Perkins
said she liked it herself. That was the reason
she chose it for Dora to take to the beach.</p>

<p>Dora remembered to ask for the book for
Father about the marionettes and she told
Miss Perkins about seeing them in Boston.
She was pleased to know that Miss Perkins
had seen those very plays, the rabbit play and
the one about Jack.</p>

<p>Miss Perkins found two books for Father to
read about them. One was a big book and she
thought it was rather heavy for Dora to carry,
but Dora thought she could manage it. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
or twice on the way home, she would rest it on
a wall.</p>

<p>The weather grew so cool that even the big
girls played games at recess. It was pleasanter
to run about than to stand still and let the
wind blow right through one. To stand still,
it was necessary to get into a corner where the
sun shone brightly and the wind couldn’t come.</p>

<p>Miss Leger always dismissed her children
before Miss Scott’s room came out, and Dora
would wait for Lucy. One afternoon, Miss
Scott’s class filed out, walking two and two
across the school grounds to the sidewalk,
where they broke ranks and began to skip and
prance. Dora was waiting, but Lucy was not
in the file.</p>

<p>“Where is Lucy?” she asked Dorothy
Barrows.</p>

<p>“Miss Scott kept her after school,” said
Dorothy. “Lucy has been very naughty, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
naughty that we are none of us to tell what
she did.”</p>

<p>Dora felt sorry to hear this, but she could
not believe that Lucy had been more than a
little naughty. The other children all went
home, but Dora waited in the cold wind, trying
to keep warm by jumping up and down. She
kept looking at the schoolhouse to see when
Lucy came.</p>

<p>It grew later and later and Dora was afraid
that Mother would worry, but she could not
leave Lucy to walk home alone. Lucy would
need to be comforted when she came out.</p>

<p>After a long time Lucy did come, and her
face was swollen with crying and her eyes were
red. In her hand she held a note.</p>

<p>When Dora saw the note, she knew that
Lucy had been really naughty. Anybody who
was given a note to take home had done something
shocking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Dora ran to meet Lucy and kissed her.
Then she held her arm and did not say a word.
Lucy began to cry again and walked slower
and slower. Dora was cold and wanted to
walk fast.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” Dora asked when
they had gone about a block. “Was Miss
Scott cross to you?”</p>

<p>Lucy nodded and choked. She tried to
speak but only cried the harder.</p>

<p>When they reached the brown cottage,
Mother was watching for them. She came
and opened the door.</p>

<p>“Where <em>have</em> you been?” she asked. “You
are very late and you know I want you always
to come straight home after school.”</p>

<p>Then Mother saw how Lucy looked. Dora
began to cry also, just because she was so
sorry for Lucy.</p>

<p>Mother took them into the warm kitchen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
asked what the matter was, but Dora did not
know, and Lucy could not tell. She sobbed
and held out the note. Mother read it.</p>

<p>Lucy cried harder than ever and so did Dora.
For a minute Mother did not say anything at
all. Then she told Dora to stop crying and
told Lucy to go and wash her face.</p>

<p>When Lucy came out of the bathroom,
Mother sat down in the rocker and took her in
her arms. She told Dora to go into the parlor
and work on the cushion for Olive.</p>

<p>Dora sewed until it began to grow dark,
which was soon, because they had been so late
coming from school. Mother never allowed
her or Lucy to light the lamp on the table, so
she looked out of the window and wished she
could do something for Lucy.</p>

<p>After a time, she heard Lucy going up to
their room and then Mother opened the door
into the parlor. Dora ran to her at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Please tell me, Mother,” she asked, with
her arms about Mother’s waist.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill sat down and took Dora on
her lap. “Lucy has done something very
wrong,” she said. “She didn’t know how to
do a problem in number-work, so she kept her
book open under her desk and copied from
it.”</p>

<p>“But she is <em>very</em> sorry,” said Dora, and the
tears came into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Merrill. “She is so
sorry that we will not say anything more to
her about it. But you will never do it, will
you, Dora?”</p>

<p>“No, Mother,” said Dora earnestly. “But
I don’t need to, you see. I like number-work
and the problems are easy for me.”</p>

<p>“I mean in anything,” said Mrs. Merrill.
“It never does any good to cheat in this world,
and it hurts only the one who does it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“I won’t, in anything,” said Dora. “May
I go and tell Lucy that I love her and that we
aren’t going to say anything about it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Merrill. “I told Lucy to
lie down for a little while because she has cried
so much that her head aches. It is her turn to
help me get supper to-night, but if you want to,
you may do it for her.”</p>

<p>Dora was glad to do this. She ran up-stairs
and kissed Lucy and whispered in her ear, and
then half-way down the stairs, she ran back and
took the Chinese kitten out of the pink box
where Arcturus used to live. She tucked it
into Lucy’s hand.</p>

<p>“Vega is very comforting to hold,” she said.
“When you come down to supper, please put
her back in her pink box.”</p>

<p>Just then, Lucy didn’t think she should
want any supper, but Dora and the kitten made
her feel better, to say nothing of the talk with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Mother. When Dora called, she put Vega
away and came down.</p>

<p>Mother had told Father and Uncle Dan not
to speak of Lucy’s red eyes, and they did not.
Only, after supper, Father took her on his knee
and talked to her a little while.</p>

<p>That night, after she and Dora were in bed,
Lucy rolled over and cuddled close to Dora.</p>

<p>“I am never going to cheat again,” she said.
“I don’t like Miss Scott and I never shall like
her, but it is because of Father and Mother.
They care so much about our doing what is
right, that we shall just have to do it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dora, snuggling into Lucy’s
arms, “we mustn’t be naughty when they care
so much.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE VICTORY PARK</span></h2>

<p>In most States October twelfth is a legal
holiday, because long ago on that day,
Columbus landed in America. He didn’t
know it was America; he thought it was Asia,
but that was the day when he arrived.</p>

<p>To celebrate in honor of Columbus seemed
hardly fair to children who learned in school
that other explorers than Columbus came here
before him. In fact, America was not named
for him, anyway, but for another voyager.</p>

<p>But the children approved of the holiday
even though the cause had become mixed during
the centuries. This especial Columbus
Day was to be celebrated in Westmore as none
had ever been before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Away back in June the plan was made, and
all summer long, men and women had been arranging
for it.</p>

<p>On the morning of October twelfth, when
the sun rose, and everybody hoped that he
would rise smiling, he would look upon a big
square meadow tucked into an edge of Westmore,
a pretty meadow with some large trees.
Around three sides were streets. On the
fourth side lay the school grounds.</p>

<p>When the sun set on October twelfth, if all
went as expected, the last thing his astonished
face would see, would be a park where the
meadow had been,—the Victory Park of Westmore.
The people were going to make it
themselves in memory of the five Westmore
boys who sailed to France at the call of duty
and didn’t come home again.</p>

<p>Judge Winslow owned the meadow and his
son was one of the five who were lying in Flanders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
with red poppies blowing in the sunshine
above their graves. The Judge said that he
would give the meadow to the town on one condition.
The town must agree to take care of
it always.</p>

<p>To arrange for this, the people of Westmore
met in June. They voted to accept the
meadow, and promised that forever and forever,
they would keep it as a park.</p>

<p>They asked the Judge if he would like them
to call it Winslow Park, but the Judge said
not. Both he and Mrs. Winslow knew that
Lieutenant Ned would not want the park to
bear his name, when the four other Westmore
boys gave their lives for their country just as
truly as he did. The memorial was to be for
them all. Why not call it the Victory
Park?</p>

<p>So the town voted for this name. Mr. Lawrence,
who knew how parks ought to look,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
measured the meadow and drew a proper plan,
showing where flower-beds should be made and
shrubbery set out. The beautiful trees already
in the meadow would stay just where they
were. The centre of the field was to be grass,
kept smooth and short. Around the edges,
curving flower-beds were planned, with gravel
walks where people could stroll in the cool of
the evening.</p>

<p>At one side of the meadow stood an oak-tree
and under it a large boulder. When the
park was completely finished there would be
on the boulder a bronze tablet, saying that the
people of Westmore had made the park in
memory of their five boys.</p>

<p>Early in the summer a copy of the plan
Mr. Lawrence made was hung in the Town
Hall. Beside it was tacked a large sheet of paper,
divided into columns. At the head of each
column stood the name of a plant or a shrub,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and the number of each Mr. Lawrence thought
would be needed. Anybody who could spare
that plant from his garden or who wanted to
buy it for the Victory Park, wrote his name in
the proper column. Long before summer was
over the columns were full of names and every
plant and shrub had been promised.</p>

<p>There were to be tulips and daffodils also in
the park and these the children gave. Every
child in school brought five cents to buy one
bulb.</p>

<p>The farmers promised to lend their horses
and carts and tools, and all those belonging to
the town were to be ready for people to use.
Mr. Harper had charge of the day’s work.
Everybody was to do what he directed.</p>

<p>To make the Victory Park would take all
day, so the ladies said that at noon they would
serve a lunch in the Town Hall for the workers.
This would be their part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Every person in Westmore was to have a
chance to help in some way. Even the kindergarten
children were planned for.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill was one of the ladies to provide
the lunch. Mr. Merrill and Uncle Dan were
to help dig the park. You will see what Lucy
and Dora did.</p>

<p>On the evening of the eleventh, everybody
went to bed prepared to get up early. Tools
were laid ready, and also old clothes suitable
for gardening.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora expected to wake of themselves,
but they did not have a chance. Just
after six o’clock Uncle Dan opened the door of
their room and shouted to them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“In fourteen hundred ninety-two</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Columbus sailed the ocean blue.</div>
<div class="verse">Awake, arise! though yet ’tis dark,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To-day we make our Victory Park.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Dan!” groaned Lucy, but Dora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
sat up and looked at Dan. Then she laughed
into her pillow for almost a minute.</p>

<p>Before eight a big crowd collected on the
meadow which was to be a park before the sun
set. First they sang “America.” Then Mr.
Harper made a little speech and reminded
them why they were making the park, out of
gratitude to the heroic boys who helped save
the country from great peril. One of the
ministers prayed that their work might be
blessed for themselves, and for all the children
who in years to come would play in the Victory
Park.</p>

<p>Then everybody watched while the mothers
and fathers of the five heroes each took a spade
and turned one sod.</p>

<p>The minute that was done the work started.
The people who were to plough the field
brought the horses, harnessed ready to begin.
Behind the plows came harrows, and behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
them men and boys with garden forks, to remove
stones and shake out sods of turf.</p>

<p>The flower-beds had been carefully marked
with stakes, and the people who were to make
them ready began to dig, one set of people to
each bed. Many of the young men were in
their old khaki uniforms, and the young women
came in overalls and bloomers in which they
had been farmerettes during the war.</p>

<p>There was only one mix-up. The committee
who were to make the gravel paths wanted
to make them at once, and this interfered with
the people who were trying to dig the flower-beds.
Mr. Harper explained to the gravel-path
people that they would really have to
wait.</p>

<p>Grace Benson had brought her donkey. Its
name was Souris, which is the French for a
mouse, and it was all mouse-color except the
black tips of its ears and tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Grace expected Souris to help about making
the park, but what could one wee donkey do?
Souris was very small, and the moment Grace
led him among the people he began to shiver
and shake until his harness rattled.</p>

<p>Nobody knew why Souris was afraid. Perhaps
he did not like the big cart-horses several
times larger than he; perhaps they spoke unkindly
to him in horse language; at any rate,
Souris stood still and shook from nose to tail.
Only when Grace put her arms about his neck
and spoke comfortingly to him did he stop
trembling. The minute she took her arms
away he began shivering again.</p>

<p>Clearly Souris was of no use, and Grace
took him home. He looked so miserable that
nobody wanted him to stay and keep on feeling
unhappy, but Grace felt ashamed of him.</p>

<p>At first only the older people could work,
because horses and machines were needed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
there was nothing the children could do. But
soon they could help.</p>

<p>The Boy Scouts cleaned a little brook which
ran through the meadow. All proper parks
have a brook or a lake, and so it was fortunate
that the meadow possessed one. To plant
flowers and bushes was easy, but to coax a
brook to come from another place and run
through the Victory Park might have been
hard.</p>

<p>The boys took out of the brook all the tin
cans which thoughtless people had thrown into
it. Never again would there be tin cans in the
Victory brook. They pulled out sticks and
branches and took away some stones, but only
those which Mr. Lawrence said were to go.
Some must be left so the brook could make
pretty ripples and have something over which
to sing.</p>

<p>There were also stones in the meadow for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
children to pick up and carry to baskets on the
edge of the field. As fast as filled, men emptied
these baskets into tip-carts, which took
the stones away. The older boys raked where
directed, so as to make the earth the proper
level.</p>

<p>The committees which had charge of the
flowers dug the beds and did it very thoroughly.
They dug down nearly two feet and
put in fertilizer so the roots of the new plants
would have plenty of food. They prepared
the beds and then said that they must have
water. The summer had been so dry that the
plants could not grow unless the earth was
made wet all around the roots.</p>

<p>Nobody had thought that there must be
water. Mr. Harper went into the nearest
house and telephoned to the fire station. The
hose-cart came immediately and fastened
a hose to the hydrant. Any amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
water could be turned anywhere it was
wanted.</p>

<p>The committee in charge of each bed had a
copy of Mr. Lawrence’s plan. This told them
exactly how many plants and shrubs were to
go in the bed and where they were to be set.
When the ground was ready the head of each
committee put a marker where each was to be
planted.</p>

<p>The High School students planted the
shrubs, and then came the turn of the smaller
children. Each of them carried a bulb and
marched in line to the flower-bed appointed.</p>

<p>Each one dug a little hole for his bulb and
put it in with care to get it right side up.
Bulbs never grow so well when they are
planted with their heads down. Then a Boy
Scout with a water-pot gave it a drink, and the
child covered it with loam and patted it down
hard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>The kindergarten children planted tulips.
Dora’s class planted daffodils and Lucy’s class
did the jonquils. Every child in the public
schools had a share in making the Victory
Park.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the ladies had been getting lunch
in the Town Hall. Some of the older men
who had stiff knees and couldn’t work out of
doors, set up the long tables and brought settees
and dishes. Promptly at twelve the fire
whistle blew long and loud. It wasn’t for a
fire at all, but the signal that everybody was
to stop working and go to lunch in the Town
Hall.</p>

<p>The park looked like nothing at all, but it
did look as though there might be hope for it
by sunset.</p>

<p>Some of the men, especially those who wore
stiff collars and went into Boston every day,
thought they were much too dirty to go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
lunch. They said they would go home and
wash.</p>

<p>Mr. Harper took a megaphone and spoke
through it. He asked the men not to go home.
He told them to brush off the dust and loam
and to wash their hands at the hydrant. Most
of them laughed and did just as Mr. Harper
said.</p>

<p>Very soon all the tables in the long hall were
filled, and everybody was hungry. There is
nothing like digging in the dirt to make people
ready for dinner.</p>

<p>The good things the ladies had been cooking
vanished like snow before the sun. There was
cold meat of various kinds, a great many baked
potatoes, string-beans, and beets, and squash.
For dessert were doughnuts and pies and
coffee and ice-cream.</p>

<p>Girls of Olive’s age waited on the tables.
Lucy and Dora wanted dreadfully to help, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
that was one of the things they could not do
until they were older. Five hundred people
sat down together at lunch in the Westmore
Town Hall.</p>

<p>When they had finished eating, Mr. Harper
made another suggestion. He asked every
person at the table to pick up the dishes he had
used and to carry them into the kitchen on his
way out of the hall.</p>

<p>At this everybody laughed and the waitresses
clapped their hands. For them to clear those
long tables would be a great deal of work, but
to clear them in Mr. Harper’s way would take
hardly any time at all.</p>

<p>Everybody picked up all the dishes he could
carry and left them in the kitchen. There
were still salt-shakers and bread-and-butter
plates and pickle dishes to remove, but that did
not take very long. And then the old men
took away the tables and put the settees in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
place. The hall was now ready for some other
use, for a meeting or a lecture.</p>

<p>The children ate sandwiches made of the
meat and bread which was left and they also
finished the doughnuts and the ice-cream.
Then people began to wash the dishes.</p>

<p>There were ten washers, and each had two
girls to wipe for her, and it was amazing
how fast those piles of dishes vanished. As
soon as they were wiped, they were packed in
baskets. Every church in town had loaned its
crockery and silver for the Victory lunch.</p>

<p>By four o’clock the dishes were all washed
and sorted. Each church had its own. There
was one spoon which nobody claimed. And
by that hour the chaos in the park was changing
into order.</p>

<p>The patient people who were to make the
gravel walks got a chance to do so. The
centre of the meadow was now as smooth as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
table. The land had been ploughed, harrowed,
raked, fertilized, and planted with lawn seed.
Then it had been rolled with a big iron roller
drawn by two horses. Where rough, uneven
sod had lain was now a smooth brown level.</p>

<p>The flower-beds were planted and raked
within an inch of their lives. All the shrubs
and clumps of perennials were in place. You
could imagine how beautiful the curved beds
were going to look. The bulbs didn’t show,
being tucked underground to sleep till Spring
called them. Each flower-bed was outlined
with turf, put in place and pounded down.</p>

<p>Everybody watched the gravel paths being
made. They waited until the last man raked
himself out of the park. The sun’s rim was
nearing the horizon. There were backs that
ached and hands that showed blisters, for if you
are used to sitting in an office, or writing for
hours at a desk, it is not easy to spend a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
day digging dirt. Everybody was tired, but
everybody was pleased and happy. The Victory
Park was done!</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">HALLOWE’EN</span></h2>

<p>Before many days the winds finished
what work Jack Frost didn’t attend
to himself. The leaves were neatly
whisked from all the trees except the oaks and
the evergreens. Oaks are cold trees. They
keep most of their leaves on all winter and let
them drop only when Spring sends word that
she is on the way with a new gown for each.
Such pretty secrets some of the trees revealed!
Who suspected birds’ nests until the boughs
were bare?</p>

<p>In the gutters of the Westmore streets lay
drifts of leaves through which the children
loved to rustle on their way to school. The
autumn air was full of the pleasant smell of
their burning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>About the farms on the outskirts of town,
cabbages were piled in green or purple heaps.
Ears of corn dangled from barn rafters, drying
for seed next year. In rows on the piazzas sat
pumpkins.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora greatly wanted pumpkins
because in a few days it would be Hallowe’en.
On that evening the Westmore children
dressed up and pretended to be goblins and
ghosts. Every respectable ghost lighted its
way with a pumpkin lantern.</p>

<p>The children consulted Father. He asked
Mother if the pumpkins could be made into
pies after they had been lanterns. Mother
thought a moment and said she could use them.</p>

<p>Father bought two small pumpkins. Lucy
wanted to make her own lantern and so did
Dora, but they found the shell much harder
than they expected. Mother was so afraid
they would cut themselves that she would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
let them take the sharpest kitchen knife.
When Father came home from work both little
girls were glad to let him help them.</p>

<p>Father did not find it hard to cut off the top
of each pumpkin, but Mother let <em>him</em> have a
sharp knife. Lucy and Dora scooped out the
soft part with the seeds, and Father cut eyes
and a nose and a mouth in each lantern.
Lucy’s had teeth with sharp points, which
made it look cross, but Dora’s had a smooth,
curved, smiling mouth.</p>

<p>Mother found a bit of candle for each, and
they lighted them and turned down the gas to
see how they were going to look. They looked
decidedly spooky.</p>

<p>The last day of October was windy and cold,
but when the sun went down the wind went
with it. This was lucky, because if it had not
stopped, the policemen would not let the children
build bonfires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Directly after supper Lucy and Dora began
to dress as ghosts. Each wore an old pillow-case
in which Mother said they might cut holes
for eyes and noses and arms. Mother tied the
points so they looked like ears. She also tied
tapes around their necks to make the cases fit
better. Then their eye-holes would not slide
about.</p>

<p>“I declare!” she said when they were
dressed. “I wouldn’t like to meet you in the
dark myself!”</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora jumped up and down with
delight. If Mother felt that way, mere strangers
would be terribly scared.</p>

<p>Father lighted the lanterns. He told them
to be very careful not to set themselves on fire,
and not to go near any burning leaves.</p>

<p>Mother told them not to go down into the
square because big and rough boys might be
out. She told them to keep in their own part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of town and to ring door-bells only where they
knew the people who lived in the houses.</p>

<p>The children said they would remember and
skipped happily away. Underneath the pillow-cases
they wore warm sweaters. First
they rang the Bakers’ bell and Marion rushed
to the door. She stopped short when she saw
the two white figures with their lanterns.</p>

<p>“It is Lucy and Dora!” she exclaimed. “I
am almost ready to come out. Which way are
you going?”</p>

<p>They told her and ran off to make another
call. The grown people in Westmore were
very patient with the children that evening.
They opened their doors when the bells rang
and spoke pleasantly to the little ghosts.
Some of them pretended to be afraid and most
of them admired the sweet smile of Dora’s lantern.
One gentleman gave them each a chocolate
cream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Being a spook must be hungry work,”
he said. Lucy and Dora told him that it
was.</p>

<p>Only a few houses kept their porch lights
burning and wouldn’t give the children the fun
of having the door opened for them.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora went to call at Miss Page’s
home on the hill. Miss Page seemed to be expecting
visitors, for she came to the door herself,
screamed loudly and then guessed that the
ghosts were Alice and Grace. The ghosts giggled
and shook their heads.</p>

<p>“Iris and Mary,” suggested Miss Page, and
she did not guess Lucy and Dora until she had
named all the girls in her Sunday-school class.
When the ghosts took little leaps she knew she
had guessed correctly.</p>

<p>She gave them each a wee cake with pink
icing and told them not to fall down the front
steps and to be careful of their lanterns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Next to Miss Page’s home stood Mr. Harper’s
big house.</p>

<p>“Let us go in here,” said Lucy when they
had untied the tapes on each other’s masks,
eaten the little cakes, and then tied the tapes
again.</p>

<p>“Alice will be out with the others,” said
Dora.</p>

<p>“I know it, but there are some people at
home. I can see her father sitting by the fire
in the room where the curtain is up.”</p>

<p>Very softly the children crept on the porch
and found the electric bell. In a minute they
heard steps in the hall and the porch light
came on.</p>

<p>They did not run but stood in silence, holding
their grinning lanterns. Mr. Harper
opened the door and when he saw them he
looked for a second and then threw his arms up
into the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Help, Mamma!” he shouted. “Ghosts,
Mamma! Come and save me!”</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora couldn’t help giggling.
They had not expected him to act like that.
They didn’t think Mrs. Harper would come,
but she did.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” she said. “What shall we
do, James? Ghosts! and not an inch of mosquito
netting in the house!”</p>

<p>This was too much for Dora. She was
so interested that she forgot she was a
spook.</p>

<p>“Don’t ghosts like mosquito netting?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” said Mr. Harper. “It
gives them hay fever. Harriet,” he said to his
wife, “how <em>could</em> you let the mosquito netting
run out?”</p>

<p>Lucy began to think Mr. Harper was crazy,
but Dora knew he wasn’t. Uncle Dan talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
in just that way. She laughed and so did Mrs.
Harper.</p>

<p>“Come in, won’t you?” asked Mr. Harper,
opening the door wider.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Lucy. “We have a
great many other calls to make. But is Alice
at home?”</p>

<p>“She is out being a goblin,” said Mrs.
Harper. “I think you will find her on School
Street. Could you each eat a caramel?”</p>

<p>The ghosts needed no second invitation.
They thanked Mrs. Harper. “Do you know
us?” Dora asked as they were going.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harper smiled. “Yes, I know you,
Dora,” she said. “Mrs. Merrill’s little girls
are ladies even when they wear pillow-cases.”</p>

<p>“What did she mean?” Dora asked Lucy
as they went down the steps. Lucy didn’t
know, but when they asked Mother, she seemed
to understand, though she didn’t tell them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>After they had called on all the people they
knew in that part of town they went to Olive’s
house, but she was out, having a Hallowe’en
frolic herself.</p>

<p>Next, the children joined one of the groups
in the street. It was holding hands and dancing
around a bonfire. The fire was right in
the centre where one street crossed another and
the automobiles could not pass. The automobiles
did not like it at all, but there stood Mr.
Waterman, the tall policeman, and he made
them all go around another block. This night
belonged to the children.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora danced for a time and then
began to feel rather tired. The fire was dying
down and Mr. Waterman yawned behind a veil
of smoke.</p>

<p>Before they reached home they met Father,
who seemed to be out for a walk. He did not
<em>say</em> he was looking for them, but it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
usual for him to walk about the streets at night
unless he were going to church or to a lecture
or to his lodge-meeting.</p>

<p>Father offered to carry their lanterns and
both were willing to let him. Even small
pumpkins grow heavy when carried around for
an hour and a half.</p>

<p>The front porch was peppered with beans
which boys had blown through air-guns.
Mother thought it wrong for them to waste
food in that way.</p>

<p>“Did you have any callers while we were
gone?” Lucy asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Merrill. “Ten different
ghosts have called on me. I gave each an animal
cracker and they went away at once. One
ghost said that elephants didn’t agree with
him, so might he have a lion.”</p>

<p>“Did you change it for him?” asked Dora.</p>

<p>“I did,” said Mrs. Merrill.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">A BUSY SATURDAY</span></h2>

<p>When November came, an interesting
thing happened to the Merrill
children. There had been a number
of letters from Miss Chandler. Mother and
Father talked about them after the little girls
were in bed. Father had taken the letters to
show Mr. Thorne.</p>

<p>One afternoon Mother told Lucy and Dora
that both were to have music lessons. Lucy
was to learn to play the piano properly, not
with two or three fingers the way she picked
out tunes now, but with all ten fingers and according
to rule. Miss Chandler and Miss
Page and Mr. Thorne thought it would be
nice for Dora to have a little violin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Chandler was sure that Dora could
learn to play. She had a friend who had already
chosen a fiddle for Dora. It wasn’t full-sized,
but was otherwise just what grown people
used. Dora thought it was beautiful.</p>

<p>Alice Harper had a fiddle also, and when
Mrs. Merrill spoke to Mrs. Harper about a
teacher for Dora, Mrs. Harper asked Dora to
come to her house every Saturday morning
when Alice had her lesson, and take one from
the same teacher.</p>

<p>Alice’s teacher was a young man who came
from Boston. He would be glad to have two
pupils instead of one.</p>

<p>Lucy was to take piano lessons from Miss
Ball, and also on Saturday. But Miss Ball
had many pupils who wanted their lessons that
day. Lucy would have to go at eight o’clock.
This was a chilly hour for a music lesson, but
Lucy said she did not mind. They both felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
very important with music to carry about the
streets.</p>

<p>“I shall expect you to practise every day,”
said Mother. “You must remember that the
lessons cost money, and the money will be
wasted if you don’t try hard to learn.”</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora felt sure they should never
want to do something else instead of practising.
Mrs. Merrill said she hoped they
wouldn’t.</p>

<p>After her first lesson Dora felt quite discouraged.
She had expected that Mr. Irons
would show her at once how to play. Instead,
he spent all the time telling her how to hold her
fingers and how to keep the bow in the proper
position. He would not let her draw the bow
across the strings unless her fingers were just
as he wanted them.</p>

<p>Dora tried hard, but when Mr. Irons said
she had worked long enough and might listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
while Alice had her lesson, Dora decided that it
would be some time before she could play that
fiddle.</p>

<p>Alice could really play quite well, and Dora
felt more cheerful when she remembered that
there had been a time when Alice had to think
about her fingers and the way she held the bow.
If Alice could learn to do both without thinking
much about it, she could learn, too. It is a
long step toward learning how to do anything
when one realizes that it must be done a little
at a time.</p>

<p>When Dora reached home that Saturday,
Mrs. Merrill was mixing bread and Lucy was
perfectly determined to help mix it. She had
washed her hands nicely and every time Mrs.
Merrill looked the other way Lucy would make
dabs at the bread dough.</p>

<p>“Lucy,” said Mrs. Merrill, “next summer
I will show you how to make bread, but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
must leave this alone. You may make some
gingerbread if you like.”</p>

<p>Lucy flew for the cook-book. She knew
which rule Mother used, only Mother never
had to look at the book. She got out the
bowl and a spoon and the flour and the
molasses.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to bring out the whole
jug,” said Mrs. Merrill. “Pour into a cup
what the rule says.”</p>

<p>Lucy hadn’t thought of this. It was easier
than carrying out the heavy jug. She did
everything just as the rule said and didn’t notice
that Mother kept an eye on her mixing-bowl.
When the gingerbread was put into a
nicely buttered pan and safe in the oven, Lucy
gave a sigh.</p>

<p>“Don’t you wish you could make gingerbread?”
she asked Dora, who was paring
apples for Mother’s pies. The Hallowe’en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
pumpkins were already changed into pies and
eaten.</p>

<p>“I think I could make it,” said Dora.</p>

<p>Lucy was surprised, for Dora didn’t often
say things like that. “Mother, <em>could</em> she?”
she asked Mrs. Merrill.</p>

<p>“Anybody who can read can use a cook-book,
and anybody with common sense can
cook,” said Mother.</p>

<p>Lucy was quite annoyed. Neither Dora
nor Mother understood how choice that gingerbread
was going to be. She at once told
Dora that she was paring the apples
too deep.</p>

<p>“It isn’t good next to the skin,” said Dora,
and she went on paring the apples in just the
same way.</p>

<p>“Don’t be cross, children,” said Mrs. Merrill.
“You might help Dora with the apples,
Lucy, if you think you can do them better. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
want to get everything possible done before
dinner because this afternoon I mean to take
you over to the city to see about your winter
coats.”</p>

<p>“Both of us?” asked the children.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Merrill. “Saturday afternoon
isn’t a good time to go shopping, but
now you are having music lessons in the morning,
I can’t manage it then. And I don’t like
to take you out of school to go.”</p>

<p>“Are we both to have new coats?” asked
Dora. She knew that Lucy was to have one,
because she had outgrown her old one. It
could not be buttoned without squeezing hard.
Dora had expected to wear that coat herself,
and she did not like its color. The color was
brown.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Merrill. “Lucy’s old
coat will do for you to wear on stormy days,
but it does not look very well. She has worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
it three winters. We have decided to buy you
a new one.”</p>

<p>Dora was delighted. People in the little
brown cottage thought twice before spending a
dollar. Father had told the children that he
was saving money so he could send them to
school a long time, and was buying insurance.
That meant if anything happened so Father
could not work in the printing-press, there
would still be money to take care of Mother
and the little girls. Dora had not expected to
have a new coat.</p>

<p>“Will it be blue, Mother?” she asked after
a time. Lucy was paring apples now, and
Dora didn’t think it was quite fair for her to
choose those with nice smooth skins and leave
the specked ones for Dora to do. But she did
not say anything.</p>

<p>“Will what be blue, child?” asked Mother.
“Look at your gingerbread, Lucy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“My coat,” said Dora. Lucy dropped her
knife and flew to the oven.</p>

<p>How good that gingerbread did smell! It
had turned into a desirable brown cake.</p>

<p>“Is it done, Mother?” Lucy asked.</p>

<p>“Try it and see,” said Mrs. Merrill. “We
will look at the blue coats, Dora.”</p>

<p>Lucy brought from the pantry one of the
clean straws Mother kept to test cake. She
stuck it into her gingerbread. When she drew
it out the straw felt dry and smooth.</p>

<p>“It is done,” she said.</p>

<p>Mother took the pan out of the oven. She
tipped out the gingerbread and put it on a rack
and covered it with a cloth. “It looks very
well,” she said.</p>

<p>The fragrance of that gingerbread filled the
whole house. It even penetrated to the parlor
where Timothy was sleeping on the couch. He
had no business there and he got up and came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
into the kitchen. It was not because his conscience
pricked him, however, but because of
the gingerbread.</p>

<p>Lucy came back to the table where Dora was
working. She was so proud of her cooking
that she no longer felt cross. She took an
apple which had a big speck on the side.</p>

<p>After dinner everybody hurried to get the
dishes washed and then Mrs. Merrill and the
children went to the city. There was no need
to lock the house, for Mr. Merrill would be at
home. The printing-press did not run on Saturday
afternoons.</p>

<p>It was late before the shoppers came back.
Dora did not wait to open the packages before
telling Father that she had a pretty blue coat.
Lucy had another brown one, not like her old
coat, but a different shade of brown. To go
with the coat was a round brown sailor hat with
a ribbon hanging down the back. Dora’s hat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was just like it, only dark blue, with a blue ribbon.
Then Dora asked Father if he had been
lonesome.</p>

<p>Father said he had been too busy to be lonesome.
Dora wondered what he had been doing.
On the floor before the Franklin stove
was spread a newspaper, with chips on it, as
though Father had been whittling.</p>

<p>Mr. Merrill looked at the new coats and hats
and thought them very pretty. After supper,
when they were all in the parlor, he began to
whittle again.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora were learning their Sunday-school
lesson. Mrs. Merrill had just found
out that they had not even looked at it, and she
said it must be learned at once. She should be
much ashamed of them if they went to Sunday
school without knowing the lesson.</p>

<p>Dora hurried as much as she could. She
read the lesson and looked up the Bible references<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and tried to answer the questions. But
all the time she wondered <em>what</em> Father was
making. As soon as she finished she asked him.</p>

<p>“What do they look like?” inquired Father.</p>

<p>“Like little dolls, only in pieces,” said Dora.</p>

<p>“That’s just what they are,” said Mr. Merrill,
and then he smiled at her. Dora’s eyes
grew wide.</p>

<p>“<em>Father!</em>” she said. “Are you trying to
make marionettes like those we saw in Boston?
Are you really?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m trying to do,” said Mr.
Merrill, and he fitted a little arm to one of his
bodies. “These are just tiny ones but I
thought we’d begin small and see how we come
out.”</p>

<p>“Is it to be Jack and the Beanstalk?” asked
Dora eagerly. “Do let it be that, because we
know how to play it.”</p>

<p>“This is Jack I’m working on,” said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Merrill. “That’s his mother there, not put
together, but I don’t know whether I can make
a proper cow.”</p>

<p>“Father!” exclaimed Lucy, “Dora had a
toy cow once on wheels and the wheels were
broken. Couldn’t you use that cow? You
could take it apart at the joints.”</p>

<p>“I am a printer, not a butcher,” said Mr.
Merrill, “but I’ll look at that cow, if Dora is
willing we should use it.”</p>

<p>Dora was willing. The cow belonged to her
very little girlhood. She never played with it
now.</p>

<p>Lucy ran up-stairs and found the cow. Mr.
Merrill said it was the right size and would do
nicely. He would try strings fastened to it in
different places and perhaps they could make
it walk without taking it apart or putting
joints in its legs.</p>

<p>Dora began making plans. There could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
a set of dolls for “Cinderella,” and, of course,
they would need rabbits for the rabbit play.
She asked Father at once if he could make
some.</p>

<p>Mr. Merrill said he would prefer to finish the
marionettes for Jack before he began any
more, but he thought he could manage the rabbits.
“How about clothes?” he asked. “Can
you and Mother ’tend to that part?”</p>

<p>When they asked her, Mother looked rather
doubtful. “I can make dolls’ clothes,” she
said, “but these dolls are very small. We will
try. The clothes must fit exactly right so as
not to interfere with the strings to work their
arms and legs.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we could make paper clothes,”
suggested Dora; “paste the paper right on.”</p>

<p>“That might answer,” said Mother, “but
we will try the cloth ones. How was Jack
dressed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>The children told her and Mrs. Merrill said
she would see what she could do.</p>

<p>Father explained that the idea was really
Uncle Dan’s. Dan said it would be possible
to make a little stage for the marionettes and
that he would make one if Father would whittle
the dolls. The back of the stage was to
come up high enough so that Lucy and Dora
could stand behind and not be seen while they
were working the little puppets. All this was
to be a Christmas present from Father and
Uncle Dan.</p>

<p>Dora and Lucy thought it the nicest gift
anybody could think of. They were perfectly
sure no other little girls in Westmore would
have a Christmas present like it. Mr. Merrill
promised that if the first marionettes turned
out well he would make the characters for another
play.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora planned at once to give an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
entertainment with the theatre and invite their
Sunday-school class and Miss Page. Mrs.
Merrill agreed that this would be pleasant, but
she thought they would have to see how well the
figures would work when they were finished,
and that it might take both children a little
time to learn how to pull the strings.</p>

<p>“I would not invite Miss Page just yet,”
she said.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THANKSGIVING</span></h2>

<p>Having helped make the Victory
Park, all the Westmore children
felt responsible for its welfare. Any
dog who imprudently walked on its flower-beds,
or ran in circles on the grass-sown
level, was at once called off, scolded, and
slapped. Before the middle of November
most of the dogs understood that the park was
no place for them to play, at least when the
children saw them.</p>

<p>At that time of year nothing could be expected
to grow, but the children felt it their
duty to see that nothing was dug up nor disturbed.
Every child remembered the place
where his bulb was planted and kept an eye on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
it. When winter was gone and spring called
to the flowers, those bulb beds would have frequent
visitors.</p>

<p>All over New England November means
Thanksgiving, and it did in Westmore. There
were no cousins and no grandmother to come
to the Merrill cottage, for Uncle John lived in
far California.</p>

<p>Some time, Father said, when their ship
came in, they would buy a little Ford, and a
tent, and go to see Uncle John and Aunt Nell.
But whenever Lucy and Dora asked whether
the ship was coming, Father would smile and
shake his head.</p>

<p>Still, there was to be company for dinner.
Olive and her father were invited. Everybody
wanted Olive, and it would not be polite to ask
her without asking Mr. Gates. Olive would
not come alone, because she kept house for her
father. She would not go to the beach until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
she arranged for him to have his meals with
the people next door.</p>

<p>“Mother,” asked Dora on the Monday before
Thanksgiving, “are we going to have a
turkey?”</p>

<p>“Not at seventy-two cents a pound,” said
Mrs. Merrill. “Even if I could afford to pay
that much, I would not. I don’t think there is
any need for them to cost so much.”</p>

<p>“Will there be a chicken?” asked Dora.</p>

<p>“I think we may manage that,” said Mrs.
Merrill, “if they are at all reasonable in price,
but we may have just a nice piece of pork or
beef to roast. It isn’t <em>what</em> we have to eat that
makes the Thanksgiving dinner, child. It is
the being thankful for it.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Thorne said last Sunday that we must
save all the pennies we can for the Christmas
manger. Because there are children in Europe
and Asia who haven’t even bread to eat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know it,” said Mrs. Merrill, and she went
on sewing Dora’s school dress.</p>

<p>“I am not going to buy any more candy,”
said Dora. “Yesterday Uncle Dan gave me
ten cents for caramels. Wouldn’t you put it
in your mite-box if you were I, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Merrill. “Sometimes it
chokes me to have enough to eat when I think
about those children. If you and Lucy and
Dan are willing, we will have pork for our
Thanksgiving dinner. I will ask how much
more the chicken would cost. Then we will
put the difference into the fund for the hungry
children.”</p>

<p>“Lucy will want to,” said Dora. “Uncle
Dan may want things very nice because of
Olive. Perhaps he would be disappointed not
to have chicken. Will you ask him, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Ask him yourself, child. He’ll do it for
you if he will for anybody.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening Dora asked Uncle Dan. She
did not need to coax him. Uncle Dan had
heard about the hungry children.</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” he said. “Roast pork is good
enough for me.”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Merrill went to market she inquired
the price of a large chicken. A big one
would be needed for a dinner for seven people.
Then she bought the pork.</p>

<p>When she came home she took ninety-eight
cents from her purse and gave it to the children.
“You may divide it between your
mite-boxes,” she said.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving Day was cold and blustering,
which made the warm house seem all the more
pleasant. A cheerful fire blazed in the Franklin
stove and Father was at home.</p>

<p>He helped make the dining-table larger.
Mother put on the best table-cloth. The pattern
woven into it was bunches of drooping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
lilacs and Lucy and Dora thought it very
pretty. Mother smoothed out every wrinkle
and then the children set the table.</p>

<p>In the centre they put a vase of dark red
chrysanthemums, cold and fragrant from the
garden. Dora loved their spicy smell. They
were only about as big as buttons, but something
in their odor made her think of ferns and
brooks and pleasant things which would come
with spring.</p>

<p>Never was table set more carefully. Each
knife and fork was laid as though the proper
spot were located with a foot-rule. Dora felt
that Lucy was too particular. Lucy moved
almost everything Dora put in place.</p>

<p>When Lucy’s back was turned, Dora quietly
put things as they were before. And the distance
either moved them was so slight that
when Lucy looked back she did not notice what
Dora had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>There was to be apple-sauce, as is the custom
with roast pork, but Mother had also made
cranberry sauce because Father and Uncle
Dan were fond of it.</p>

<p>Everybody would want apple-sauce, so
Lucy took a spoon and filled seven glass
dishes. She placed one at each plate. The
cranberry sauce was in a large dish. It was to
go in front of Olive, with a spoon and more
glass saucers. Dora brought the dish from the
pantry, holding it carefully in both hands.</p>

<p>What possessed Timothy just then? He
liked to weave himself in and about people’s
feet when he was hungry, but Timmy had
eaten his dinner. If he had not been fed, there
would be no peace for anybody in the Merrill
kitchen. Timothy was not hungry and he
should have been washing his face before the
parlor fire, not walking in front of Dora.</p>

<p>Dora tripped over him. She held on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
dish, but spilled the cranberry on the table, all
over Mother’s clean Thanksgiving cloth!</p>

<p>“Now, see what you’ve done!” cried Lucy,
perfectly horrified.</p>

<p>Poor Dora picked herself up. What cranberry
wasn’t on the table-cloth was on her
pretty white dress.</p>

<p>What a dreadful thing to happen! But the
worst was that Lucy spoke as though she
thought Dora <em>meant</em> to do it. Would Mother
think the same?</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill came out of the pantry and
for a moment she looked as though she didn’t
know what to do any more than the children.
Dora stood with her lip quivering and her eyes
full of tears.</p>

<p>“Well, that <em>is</em> too bad,” said Mrs. Merrill.
“Stop crying, Dora; it doesn’t mend matters.
Of course you didn’t mean to do it.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill looked at the table-cloth.
Then she looked at Dora and looked at the
clock. She unbuttoned Dora’s dress.</p>

<p>“Take this into the shed, Lucy,” she said,
“and put it in one of the tubs. Go and put on
your blue gingham, Dora. Hurry, both of
you, for we must take off the dishes and put on
another cloth.”</p>

<p>Trying not to cry, Dora went up-stairs.</p>

<p>“Dora was very careless, wasn’t she?” asked
Lucy, coming back from the shed and helping
gather up the plates and silver.</p>

<p>“It was an accident,” said Mother with a
sigh. “It might have happened to you.”</p>

<p>All the same, Lucy had <em>not</em> spilled the apple-sauce,
and she felt virtuous.</p>

<p>“Put that cat out,” said Mrs. Merrill. “I
can’t have him under foot a minute longer.”</p>

<p>Lucy put the beloved pussy into the shed
and when she came back she no longer felt
proud because she had not spilled things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mother,” she said when the table was
cleared, “I think I will put on my pink gingham.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill looked at her.</p>

<p>“Because,” said Lucy, “Dora hasn’t another
white dress to wear.”</p>

<p>“That is a good plan,” said Mother, and she
smiled at Lucy.</p>

<p>Dora came back, rather wet about the eyelashes.
Lucy buttoned the blue dress and
Dora settled the Chinese kitten in place. After
all, Vega was enchanting against blue.</p>

<p>The stained table-cloth went into the tub
with Dora’s dress. There was no time to attend
to them. Mother put on another cloth,
not so fine nor so pretty, but just as white.</p>

<p>The children set the table again and this
time neither was fussy about the way the other
did things. Only at intervals Dora’s lip quivered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is there any more cranberry sauce?” she
asked Mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill shook her head. “I bought
only a quart of berries,” she said.</p>

<p>“There won’t be any for Father and Uncle
Dan,” said Dora.</p>

<p>“They never knew there was any,” said
Mrs. Merrill. “They won’t miss it at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother!” said Lucy, “something is
wrong with the gas stove.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill hurried to the stove. Yes, the
flame was turned too high and the macaroni
was scorching.</p>

<p>“This dinner seems possessed,” she sighed
as she turned down the gas and took out the
macaroni.</p>

<p>Just then Olive came running in with a gay
greeting. She kissed the little girls and
Mother, too, because it was Thanksgiving.
She ran up-stairs and left her coat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
hat in the children’s room. Then she flew
down.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” she asked. “Mash
these potatoes?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Merrill. “Unless you’d
rather make the gravy.”</p>

<p>“Your gravy is better than mine,” said
Olive and she stuck a fork into the potatoes.
They were done and she whisked them off the
stove.</p>

<p>With Olive’s coming, ill-luck went away.
Nobody upset anything more, and nothing
burned.</p>

<p>Father, Uncle Dan, and Mr. Gates came in
together and Mother sent them directly into
the parlor. She said it was bad enough to
have a cat getting underfoot; she could not
stand three men.</p>

<p>When they sat down to dinner, nobody could
have guessed that the table had twice been completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
set. If Olive noticed that this was not
the best table-cloth, she didn’t say anything,
but of course, nobody <em>would</em> be so rude as to
speak of a thing like that.</p>

<p>The roast pork was done to a turn. Everybody
enjoyed it and was glad that it wasn’t
chicken. Forty-nine cents apiece, in two
mite-boxes, would be quite an addition to the
Christmas manger.</p>

<p>They sat a long time at the table, talking
and enjoying the early twilight. Indeed, it
was really dark when the last piece of pie was
eaten and the last nut cracked.</p>

<p>“Now, we will do the dishes,” said Mr. Merrill.
“Wash or wipe, Dan?”</p>

<p>Mother Merrill gave a gasp and the children
laughed. Sometimes, Father wiped dishes,
but neither he nor Uncle Dan was ever trusted
to wash them.</p>

<p>Uncle Dan was game. He took Mother’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
apron from behind the door and put it on. He
got out the dish-pan.</p>

<p>“Dan, you will never get those kettles
clean,” said Mrs. Merrill, but she did not speak
as though she <em>meant</em> him to stop. Mother was
tired. She had cooked dinner and still had
Dora’s dress and the table-cloth to wash.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> shall wash,” said Olive, grabbing another
apron. “Dan and Dad shall wipe. Molly
Merrill, you may gather up the food and put it
away. Mr. Merrill may scrape the dishes.”</p>

<p>Everybody did what Olive said. In half
an hour all the kettles and dishes were clean
and in place. The dish-wipers were rinsed
and hung to dry and the kitchen was tidy and
cosy. There was nothing to do but enjoy
themselves.</p>

<p>Olive and Uncle Dan went out to walk.
They said they needed exercise. The rest
went into the parlor and sat before the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
fire. Mr. Merrill got out the marionettes and
began to whittle.</p>

<p>Mr. Gates was much interested. He took
a piece of wood and opened his own knife. He
said he used to do something in that line himself.</p>

<p>On the edge of the open stove the children
put some chestnuts to roast. Father had
brought them purposely for the evening.
Each nut had slits cut on one side. If this
were not done, the heated nut would sometimes
shoot across the room or even explode. Lucy
and Dora had learned that it was best to cut
the slit.</p>

<p>Mother brought her knitting and the children
sat on the floor and watched the chestnuts
and Mr. Merrill and Mr. Gates whittling.</p>

<p>“It is a good plan,” said Mr. Merrill, “to
put into words sometimes how much we have
to be thankful for. Now I am glad I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
a home and a family and a paying job. What
are you thankful for, Mother?”</p>

<p>“For my home and my family, and yes—for
my job, too,” said Mother with a little laugh.
“That my husband never drinks and that Dan
is a good lad.”</p>

<p>“I am thankful for my daughter,” said Mr.
Gates, “even though I expect to go shares in
her some day.”</p>

<p>“Your turn, Lucy,” said Mr. Merrill,
smiling.</p>

<p>“I am thankful for the marionettes you are
making and for my new coat,” said Lucy, after
thinking half a minute.</p>

<p>“How about Dora?” asked Mr. Merrill.</p>

<p>“I am thankful for my Chinese kitten and
that I had Arcturus once,” said little Dora.
“That I have enough to eat, not like the poor
children across the sea. And that Mother
doesn’t scold when I spill the cranberry sauce.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">CHRISTMAS</span></h2>

<p>Every day in the year has the same
number of hours, but some days skim
past like an automobile and some creep
like a snail at a gallop. The days between
Thanksgiving and Christmas are of the motor-car
variety. There is so much to do, and to
think of, that people can scarcely believe the
clock. Lucy and Dora were as busy with their
plans as were the grown people.</p>

<p>Dora made several pretty calendars for
gifts. She hemmed a duster for Miss Chandler
and another for Mother. She thought
Miss Chandler would find use for a duster in
her three rooms, especially a cream-white one,
feather-stitched all around in blue.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill suggested this gift and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
thought Dora took a good while to make it.
She did not know that Dora made a second
one, precisely like the first. She made it under
Mother’s very nose, and Mother never saw
it. Lucy and Dora both thought this was very
funny, and could not help laughing, but it
never occurred to Mrs. Merrill that the duster
Dora was working on was not always the same
one.</p>

<p>On Christmas eve there was a church service.
Miss Page asked her class to come early.
This was an important occasion because the
mite-boxes for the hungry children in other
countries were to be collected.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Merrill were going with the
children, but they would sit in the back of the
church. Lucy and Dora were to sit with their
class. The class was to sit in pew twenty-eight.</p>

<p>There had been many things to do that afternoon,
and nobody looked out until they started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
for church. When the door shut behind the
Merrill family, everybody was surprised.</p>

<p>Christmas came on a moonlight night that
year, but in addition to the moon, at almost
every house the porch light was shining, and
the ordinary electric bulbs had been unscrewed
and red ones substituted. All up and down the
streets shone the pretty red lights.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother!” said Lucy. “I wish our
house had one. But it is only gas, and none
at all on the porch.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill thought a minute. The red
lights did look pretty. In the front windows
of the brown cottage hung Christmas wreaths
but there was no light behind them.</p>

<p>“Wait for me a bit,” she said, and she went
back into the cottage.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora wondered what she was going
to do. A group of young people went by.
They were singing softly and Father began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
sing with them. When Father was a young
man, he used to belong to the choir.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“It came upon the midnight clear,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">That glorious song of old,</div>
<div class="verse">Of angels bending near the earth,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To touch their harps of gold.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><em>What</em> was Mother doing? She had lighted
the lamp on the parlor table, but what was
keeping her now?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Still through the cloven skies they come,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">With peaceful wings unfurled:</div>
<div class="verse">And still their heavenly music floats</div>
<div class="verse indent2">O’er all the weary world.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dora looked up at the sky. The moon was
so bright that only the largest stars could show
to-night. There was Orion with his flaming
belt and sword. Dora knew several star-groups
now. She and Uncle Dan and Olive
had gone out one night with a flash-light and
the star-book from the Public Library and
traced them. Still, Mrs. Merrill did not come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Father,” asked Dora, “do you think
angels come down to earth now?”</p>

<p>“If they ever come, it is at Christmas,” said
Father, and he went on humming the words
which were now faint in the distance.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“O rest beside the weary road,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And hear the angels sing.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly the windows of the Merrill parlor
turned a warm crimson. From them streamed
a soft red light.</p>

<p>“Oh, look, Father! Look, Dora!” exclaimed
Lucy. “Now, we have a red light,
too!”</p>

<p>“I thought Mother would fix it somehow,”
said Mr. Merrill.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merrill came out while the children
were still exclaiming. “How did you do it?”
Dora asked.</p>

<p>“With Dan’s red silk scarf,” said Mrs. Merrill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
pulling on her gloves again, and looking
back at the pretty light.</p>

<p>“Safe against fire, Molly?” asked Mr. Merrill.
“We wouldn’t like to go to church and
come home to find the house burned.”</p>

<p>“It can’t take fire,” said Mrs. Merrill.</p>

<p>The minute they entered the vestibule, spicy
smells of spruce and evergreen greeted them.
The church was warm and all the rafters were
draped with festoons of green. The only light
was in the chancel and what came from two big
Christmas trees on either side of the chancel
arch. They were strung with wee red bulbs,
and at the top of each tree shone a star. Between
the trees stood the manger for the gifts.</p>

<p>When the choir came, in place of their usual
white cottas, they wore bright red ones. How
Christmas-y the church did seem!</p>

<p>There were carols and Christmas hymns and
then one by one, the classes took up their mite-boxes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and placed them in the manger.
People had brought other gifts for the poor.
All the children looked over their toys and selected
something to go to the Children’s Hospital.</p>

<p>Lucy chose a doll of which she was not very
fond. Dora brought a set of blocks, which she
liked very much. She did not often play with
them now, but because she had enjoyed them
so much herself, she thought children who were
not very sick—just beginning to get better—might
care for them.</p>

<p>The Christmas eve service did not last long,
but it left everybody with a pleasant and
peaceful feeling.</p>

<p>All the red lights were yet burning
and almost every house had wreaths in the
front windows. The children were pleased as
they came near the brown cottage to hear people
speak of how pretty the red lamp looked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll let it burn a long time, won’t you,
Mother?” begged Dora.</p>

<p>“It may burn until Father and I go to bed,”
said Mrs. Merrill. “You children had better
be off early, so as to give Santa Claus a
chance.”</p>

<p>“There is to be a surprise for <em>you</em>, to-morrow,”
said Dora, and she and Lucy both giggled.</p>

<p>“There will be surprises for everybody,”
said Mrs. Merrill, “but I think the biggest one
will be for Dora.”</p>

<p>When Mother said this Dora almost flew up
in the air. On any time but Christmas eve, she
could not have borne the suspense. But she
would know early in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. Merrill unlocked the door and they all
went into the cosy house. And there, on a
table near the parlor door, stood a fairy Christmas
tree!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>It was only about eighteen inches high,
planted in a flower-pot full of sand. At the
top shone a silvery star, and from the star
dropped webs that looked as though very large
spiders had been spinning silver lace.
Through the shimmery mist showed the green
branches.</p>

<p>The tree had not been there when they went
to church! The children stared in surprise and
danced about the room. It was not until they
had jumped around for a minute or two that
they saw Mother was as surprised as anybody.
She looked at the lovely tree and then at Father.</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it, Molly,” he said smiling.</p>

<p>“But you know who did,” said Mrs. Merrill.</p>

<p>“Cross my heart, I don’t,” declared Father.</p>

<p>How Lucy and Dora laughed to hear him
say this. They looked again at the wee tree.
Red candies were tied to its branches with silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
cord, and white sugar-plums with red
string. That was all the fruit it bore.</p>

<p>“Now, didn’t you put it there yourself,
Mother?” asked Mr. Merrill. “When you
went back to light the lamp?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” said Mrs. Merrill. “It wasn’t
there then and I never saw it before, and the
house has been locked all the time we were at
church.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> odd how a Christmas tree could get
into a locked house,” agreed Mr. Merrill.
“Had we better report it to the police?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go so far as that,” said Mrs.
Merrill. “Here’s Dan. He may know.”</p>

<p>“I was at church,” protested Dan. “Didn’t
you see me singing in the choir in a very fancy
rig?”</p>

<p>“Uncle Dan,” said Dora, “did you ever <em>see</em>
that tree before?”</p>

<p>“How can I tell?” said Dan. “There have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
been several hundred Christmas trees in the
square this past week. I don’t know one from
another.”</p>

<p>Dora held him firmly. “Did you put that
tree in here?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I did not,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Did you unlock the door so somebody
could bring it in?” Lucy asked.</p>

<p>“I did not,” said Dan.</p>

<p>The children looked at each other. Then
Dora had a bright idea.</p>

<p>“Uncle Dan,” she demanded, “did you
<em>lend</em> your key to somebody while you went to
church?”</p>

<p>“I have answered three questions and that
is enough!” said Dan. And he never did answer
that one.</p>

<p>All the family hung up their stockings.
Lucy and Dora put theirs on the brass knobs
either side of the open stove. Mr. and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Merrill fastened theirs to the ends of the sofa.
Uncle Dan went out again, but Dora hung his
sock to the back of Mother’s rocking-chair.
She and Lucy took one last look at the fairy
tree and went to bed.</p>

<p>They didn’t talk and giggle more than any
little sisters do on Christmas eve and they went
to sleep before Mrs. Merrill expected. In less
than an hour she put out the red lamp.</p>

<p>It was still dark when Dora woke but a
great star was looking through the open window.
It was so big and so bright that it seemed
like the real star of Bethlehem, shining to guide
the shepherds to where the little Jesus lay.</p>

<p>The star was so beautiful that Dora looked
at it instead of wondering about her stocking.
That could wait, but the star would fade with
the dawn. She watched it a long time and saw
the sky gradually grow lighter and the star less
distinct.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as she was having hard work to see the
star, Lucy woke. “Merry Christmas, Dora!”
she exclaimed. “Let’s get up and look at our
stockings.”</p>

<p>Lucy hustled down the steep stairs, but
Dora opened the door of Uncle Dan’s room
and looked in. Only his black head showed
above the blankets. The window was wide
open and the room freezing cold, but Dora ran
in, kissed Uncle Dan’s cheek and whispered
“Merry Christmas!” in his ear.</p>

<p>Dan woke and looked at her. “Get back to
bed,” he said. “You’ll catch your death.”
And then he said, “Merry Christmas, Dora!”</p>

<p>When Dora reached the foot of the stairs,
Mr. Merrill jumped out from behind the door
to his room and gave her a big hug and a
Christmas greeting.</p>

<p>Father came into the parlor, he <em>said</em> to make
the fire burn better for the children, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Mother came the next moment, and she didn’t
give <em>any</em> excuse for coming. Most mothers
and fathers like to see the Christmas stockings
opened.</p>

<p>The stockings were knobby and puffed and
would be most uncomfortable to wear if they
should stay that shape. Some packages were
too big even to go in. These were on the floor
under the stockings.</p>

<p>Lucy and Dora began to open the gifts, and
everything they opened they liked very much.</p>

<p>From Mother there was a pretty woolen cap
and muffler, a brown set for Lucy and a blue
one for Dora. Both were much pleased, because
all the girls were wearing them.</p>

<p>Olive gave Lucy a box of pretty handkerchiefs
and Dora some writing paper with a
blue M at the top. It was like some which
Olive had at the beach and which Dora admired.
Olive’s paper was marked G.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Page gave each a little New Testament.
There was also from Miss Page a cunning
bouquet. At a distance it looked like a
bunch of flowers, but each flower was a bit of
candy wrapped in oiled paper. About the
bouquet was some paper lace. Both Lucy and
Dora were delighted.</p>

<p>Lucy liked her pincushion very much. She
had made for Dora a little silk bag in which
to carry a purse or a handkerchief.</p>

<p>Uncle Dan gave each a box of candy, besides
making the stage for the marionettes.
The stage was finished and painted. It stood
back against the parlor wall.</p>

<p>And as though Father were not making
them a big present by whittling the puppets for
the theatre, he gave them each a book. Lucy’s
was “When Mother Lets Us Cook.”</p>

<p>Only the fact that she was not dressed kept
Lucy from rushing into the kitchen and trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
a receipt. Besides, Mother said quite emphatically
that she wasn’t doing any “letting”
at that hour in the morning. Later in the day,
she would see about it.</p>

<p>What do you think was the name of Dora’s
book? She could scarcely believe her eyes.
When she did believe them, she could not
speak, only look at Father and then hug him
hard.</p>

<p>Father had gone to the Public Library and
asked Miss Perkins which book Dora liked
best. Miss Perkins remembered. Indeed, it
would be strange if she did not know, for Dora
had borrowed the book five times since September.
Father had bought her the “Story of
Doctor Dolittle.”</p>

<p>“It <em>was</em> the biggest surprise, Mother!”
Dora said, when she had thanked Father again
and again and looked at the pictures for about
the fortieth time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, that isn’t the surprise,” said Mrs. Merrill.</p>

<p>“It <em>isn’t</em>!” said Dora. “What can it be?”</p>

<p>She got down from Father’s knee and took
her limp stocking from the knob. In the toe
was still a small package.</p>

<p>In the toe of hers, Lucy had just found the
white Chinese kitten and was speechless with
pleasure. She liked it better than Dora’s blue
one.</p>

<p>“Because there really are white kittens,” she
said.</p>

<p>“There are blue ones, too,” said Dora.
“Aunt Margaret told me so. Blue Persian
cats.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think they are just like yours,” said
Lucy.</p>

<p>Dora had never seen a Persian blue, so she
did not say anything. Besides, she was wondering
what Miss Chandler had given her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a little gold ring set with a blue stone
which Mr. Merrill thought was an aquamarine.</p>

<p>Dora didn’t care about the name, but she
liked the ring exceedingly. She slipped it on
her finger. It just fitted.</p>

<p>“This must be the big surprise,” she said to
Mother.</p>

<p>“The ring is a surprise to me,” said Mrs.
Merrill, “for I didn’t know what was in that
package. But it is not the surprise I
mean.”</p>

<p>Dora again felt her stocking and discovered
a tiny wad of tissue paper. She untwisted it
and her eyes and mouth both opened.</p>

<p>“Mother!” she exclaimed after a second,
“oh, Mother! Mother! is it really Arcturus,
my Arcturus? Where did he come from?
Oh, Mother, my bear, my own little silver
bear!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can never guess where we found him,”
said Mrs. Merrill.</p>

<p>“Did somebody find him at the beach? Did
Uncle Dan go over again?” asked Lucy, as
excited as Dora.</p>

<p>“Arcturus came home from the beach when
we did,” said Mrs. Merrill. “He has been in
Westmore all the time, though not in our
house.”</p>

<p>“Where was he?” Dora asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“He was found last week,” said Mrs. Merrill,
“but I thought since it was so near Christmas
he might as well come back in your stocking.
You remember that I went to the church
to help pack a missionary barrel?”</p>

<p>The children remembered perfectly. They
had carried some shoes to the church to go in
that barrel.</p>

<p>“When we came to pack the things,” said
Mrs. Merrill, “there was that straw hat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Olive’s, the one with the pink roses. The
flowers were faded, but the hat was really too
good for Olive to give away, and I told
her so.”</p>

<p>“While we were turning the hat about and
looking at it,” Mrs. Merrill went on, “Dora’s
silver bear dropped out of a fold of velvet. I
can’t account for his getting into it, but that is
where he was.”</p>

<p>The children knew how he got there. Lucy
remembered picking up Olive’s hat from the
sand the very morning Arcturus ran away.
All the time he was hiding in the velvet, so the
sifting of the sand didn’t make him appear.</p>

<p>“Arcturus has come home!” said Dora happily.
“How nice that he came on Christmas
morning. I felt dreadfully when he ran away,
but if he hadn’t, probably I would never have
had the Chinese kitten. I hope Arcturus won’t
be jealous of Vega.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mother,” said Lucy, “it’s your turn now.
You and Father open your presents.”</p>

<p>“Not until I am dressed,” said Mrs. Merrill.
“This sitting about in a kimono is chilly
work.”</p>

<p>“My feet <em>are</em> cold,” Lucy admitted.</p>

<p>“You and Dora run and get into your
clothes,” said Mrs. Merrill. “Come, Father.”</p>

<p>Dora made no motion to start. “My feet
are cold, too,” she said. “Father, do you think
if a person had only one foot, it could possibly
be so cold as two?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” said Mr. Merrill.</p>

<p>“I will ask Uncle Dan,” said Dora. “And
I must tell him that Arcturus has come home.
How surprised he will be! I can’t see how
Uncle Dan can sleep on Christmas morning.
I woke him once, but he must have gone to
sleep again. Father, did you know that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
star of Bethlehem was shining this morning?”</p>

<p>“Over in the east?” asked Father Merrill.
“Yes, Dora, I saw it.”</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
